    "content": "Genesis is the book of beginnings—of the universe and of humanity, of sin and its catastrophic effects, and of God’s plan to restore blessing to the world through his chosen people. God began his plan when he called Abraham and made a covenant with him. Genesis traces God’s promised blessings from generation to generation, to the time of bondage and the need for redemption from Egypt. It lays the foundation for God’s subsequent revelation, and most other books of the Bible draw on its contents. Genesis is a source of instruction, comfort, and edification.\nSetting\nWhen Genesis was written, the children of Israel had been slaves in Egypt for four hundred years. They had recently been released from bondage and guided through the desert to meet the Lord at Mount Sinai, where he had established his covenant relationship with them and had given them his law through Moses. Israel was now poised to enter the Promised Land and receive the inheritance that God had promised Abraham.\nWhile enslaved in Egypt, the Israelites had adopted many pagan ideas and customs from their Egyptian masters (see Exod 32:1-4). They were influenced by false concepts of God, the world, and human nature, and were reduced to being slaves rather than owners and managers of the land. Perhaps they had forgotten the great promises that God had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or perhaps they had concluded that the promises would never be fulfilled.\nBefore entering the Promised Land, the Israelites needed to understand the nature of God, his world, and their place in it more clearly. They needed to embrace their identity as descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  Genesis provided the needed understanding.\nSummary\nGenesis traces God’s work to overcome with blessing the curse that came on humankind because of sin. The book arranges family traditions, genealogies, historical events, and editorial comments into a single, sustained argument.\nEvery section of Genesis but the first has the heading “This is the account” (or These are the generations; Hebrew toledoth). Each of the toledoth sections explains the history of a line of descent. In each case, a deterioration of well-being is followed by an increasing focus on God’s plan to bless the world. This plan is the basis for God’s covenant with his people; as the blessing develops, the covenant is clarified. By the end of the book, the reader is ready for the fulfillment of the promises.\nThe first section (1:1–2:3) does not have the toledoth heading—it is the account of creation “in the beginning” (1:1). The work of creation is wrapped in God’s approval and blessing as he fulfills his plan.\nThe next section (2:4–4:26) focuses on the creation of human life (2:4-25) and traces what became of God’s creation because of Adam’s and Eve’s sin (3:1-13), the curse on their sin (3:14-24), and the extension of sin to their descendants (4:1-24). Humanity no longer enjoyed God’s rest; instead, they experienced guilt and fear. So they fled from God and developed a civilization marked by pride.\nIndependence from God resulted in the downward drift of human life (5:1–6:8). The genealogy of 5:1-32 begins by recalling that human beings were made in God’s image and were blessed by him (5:1-2). As the genealogy is traced, the death of each generation reminds the reader of the curse, with Enoch providing a ray of hope that the curse is not final. In 6:1-8, we learn that God regretted having made humans and decided to judge the earth. Noah, however, received God’s favor and provided a source of hope (5:29; 6:8).\nThe next section (6:9–9:29) relays the curse of judgment through the flood followed by blessing in a new beginning. Creation was renewed, purged of the abominable evil that had invaded and ruined the human race.\nBut as the world’s population increased and expanded into various nations (10:1–11:9), the people were again bent on disobedience. Because of their rebellion, God dispersed them to prevent greater wickedness (11:1-9).\nAfter the chaos of the scattered nations, 11:10-26 brings the focus to Abram, through whom God chose to bring blessing to all. The rest of the book (11:27–50:26) tells of God’s blessing Abram and his descendants. God first made a covenant with Abram (11:27–25:11), promising him a great nation, land, and name. As time went on, God made the specific terms of the covenant clearer, and Abram’s faith grew deeper.\nAs it discusses each generation, Genesis gives a brief account of the families that are not Israel’s ancestors before turning to the line of Israel. For example, after briefly reporting what became of Ishmael (25:12-18), Genesis traces in detail what happened to Isaac and his family (25:19–35:29). Likewise, Esau’s line (Edom) is dealt with briefly (36:1–37:1) before the lengthy final section, which concerns the chosen line of Jacob the heir (37:2–50:26).\nIn this final section, Genesis records how Jacob’s family winds up in Egypt rather than in the land of Canaan. In spite of the tragic set of circumstances which led to their being in Egypt, God was still unfolding his plan for the people of Israel. The book closes with the promise of the Lord’s coming to rescue his people from Egypt (50:24-26).\nAuthorship\nLike many biblical books, the author of Genesis is not explicitly identified. Many scholars have argued that the Pentateuch (Genesis—Deuteronomy) is the product of a complex literary evolution. The prevailing view, called the Documentary Hypothesis, is that Genesis through Deuteronomy was compiled from various sources. This hypothesis proposes that the Pentateuch comes from four sources: J (“Jahwist,” from “Yahweh”), E (“Elohist,” from “Elohim”), D (“Deuteronomic,” from Deuteronomy), and P (“Priestly”). It is thought that these sources were written and collected between 850 BC and 445 BC, gradually being combined and edited until around Ezra’s time (400s BC).\nBoth Scripture and tradition attribute the Pentateuch to Moses, however. Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians (Acts 7:22), and he had the literary skills to collect and edit Israel’s traditions and records and to compose this theological treatise. His unique communion with God gave him the spiritual illumination, understanding, and inspiration needed to guide him. He had good reason to write this work—to provide Israel with the theological and historical foundation for the Exodus and the covenant at Sinai, and to establish the new nation in accord with the promises made to their ancestors.\nIt is possible that Moses served as the fundamental source of the material recorded in the Pentateuch and that some editorial adjustments were subsequently made (including the record of Moses’ death, Deut 34). Regardless, the Israelites accepted the Pentateuch as bearing the full force of Moses’ authority.\nComposition\nIt is widely recognized that various sources were used in writing Genesis (and other historical texts in the Bible such as Kings and Luke. The author used collections of family records, oral traditions, ancient accounts of primeval events, and genealogies to write Genesis. Those sources could have been incorporated as received, or the author may have changed their style and wording, stitching them together with additional material for the particular purpose of tracing the foundations of Israelite faith.\nGenesis also includes passages and expressions that are obviously later editorial glosses. Some sections (such as the list of Edomite kings, 36:31-43) could have been added during the early days of the monarchy. There is no conflict in saying that Genesis was authored by Moses and augmented by subsequent editors whose work was guided by the Holy Spirit.\nLiterary Character\nGenesis includes various types of literature. Several suggestions have been made as to the nature of the materials.\nMyth.  Mythological literature explains the origins of things symbolically through the deeds of gods and supernatural creatures. For ancient peoples, myths were beliefs that explained life and reality. Whole systems of ritual activities were developed to ensure that the forces of fertility, life, and death would continue year by year. Some of these rituals gave rise to cult prostitution (see Gen 38:15, 21-22).\nIt would be very difficult to classify the material in Genesis as simply a myth alongside the other myths of the earth’s origins. Israel had one God, not a multitude. The nation of Israel had a beginning, a history, and a future hope. They saw God, rather than gods and other supernatural creatures, as the primary actor in the world. Their worship was not cosmic, magical, or superstitious, but a reenactment of their own rescue from Egypt and a celebration of God’s actual intervention in history and their hope in his promises.\nIf Genesis uses elements of mythological language, it is to display a deliberate contrast with pagan concepts and to show that the Lord God is sovereign over such ideas. For example, many ancient peoples worshiped the sun as a god, but in Genesis the sun serves the Creator’s wishes (1:14-18). The book of Genesis is a cemetery for lifeless myths and dead gods.\nEtiology.  A number of scholars describe the Genesis narratives as etiologies, stories that explain the causes of factual reality or traditional beliefs. The implication is that such stories were made up for explanatory purposes and do not describe historical events. For example, if one says that the story of Cain and Abel was made up to explain why shepherds and farmers do not get along, the account loses its integrity as factual history.\nEtiological elements certainly occur in Genesis, as the book gives the foundation and rationale for almost everything that Israel would later do. For example, the creation account of Genesis 2 ends with the explanation, “This explains why a man leaves his father and mother. . . .” The event as it happened explains why marriage was conducted the way it was, but to say that a story explains something is quite different from saying that the story was fabricated to explain it. The stories of Genesis are not simply fictional tales invented to explain later customs and beliefs.\nHistory.  Many scholars object to regarding Genesis as history, for two basic reasons: (1) Genesis explains events as caused by God, and the inclusion of the supernatural is regarded as proof that the material is theological reflection and thus not historically reliable; and (2) the events in Genesis cannot be validated from outside sources; no other records have demonstrated that Abraham existed or that any of his family history occurred.\nModern philosophies of history exclude the supernatural as an explanation of historical events, but there is no reason to do so arbitrarily. If God exists and is able to act, then he might very well be the ultimate cause of all historical events and the immediate cause of specific historical events. The Israelites were not as distrustful of supernatural events as are modern critics; they recognized such events as God acting among them to fulfill the promises recorded in Genesis.\nIt is true that no direct evidence of the patriarchs or the events in Genesis has been found, but archaeology confirms the plausibility of Genesis by showing that the historical situation in that era (Middle Bronze I, 2000–1800 BC) corresponds closely to what Genesis portrays. The details of the narratives make perfectly good sense in that context.\nTheological Interpretation.  Genesis was not intended as a chronicle of the lives of the patriarchs, a history for history’s sake, or a complete biography. It is clearly a theological interpretation of selected records of the nation’s ancestors, but this does not damage its historicity. Interpretations of an event can differ, but the offering of interpretations is a good witness to the actuality of the events. The author retold the events in his own way, incorporating particular theological emphases, but that does not mean that the stories were invented.\nTradition.  What was thus committed to writing is tradition in the reverent care of literary genius. It is possible that Abram brought the primeval accounts and the family genealogies from Mesopotamia, and stories about the family were added to these collections. Joseph could easily have preserved all the traditions, both written and oral, in Egypt with his own records. Then, Moses could have compiled the works substantially in their present form while adding his editorial comments, working under God’s inspiration and guidance.\nInstructional Literature.  Since Genesis is the first book of the Pentateuch (the “Torah” or Law), it may be best to classify it as “Torah Literature” (Hebrew torah, “instruction, law”). Genesis is instructional literature that lays the foundation for the Law. It includes theological interpretation of the historical traditions standing behind the covenant at Sinai. It thus prepares its readers to receive God’s law and to connect themselves to the promises made to their forefathers. Genesis is therefore a unique work. Theology, history, and tradition come together to instruct God’s people and prepare them for blessing.\nMeaning and Message\nIsrael’s most important questions were answered by the Genesis narratives. Life and death, the possession of the land of Canaan, and how Israel ended up in Egypt are explained as God’s providential working in history. Israel is presented as having an integral part in God’s plan for the world. His plan had a starting point at creation and will have an end point in the future when the promises are completely fulfilled.\nIsrael, the Chosen People.  The central theme of Genesis is that God made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants. He promised to make them his own people, heirs of the land of Canaan, and make them a blessing to the world. Genesis gave Israel the theological and historical basis for its existence as God’s chosen people.\nIsrael could trace its ancestry to the patriarch Abraham and its destiny to God’s promises (12:1-3; 15:1-21; 17:1-8). Because the promise of a great nation was crucial, much of Genesis is devoted to family concerns of the patriarchs and their wives, their sons and heirs, and their birthrights and blessings. The record shows how God preserved and protected the chosen line through the patriarchs. Israel thus knew that they had become the great nation promised to Abraham. Their future was certainly not in slavery to the Egyptians, but in Canaan, where they would live as a free nation and as the people of the living God, and where they could mediate God’s blessings to the people of the world.\nBlessing and Curse.  The entire message of Genesis turns on the motifs of blessing and cursing. The promised blessing would give the patriarchs innumerable descendants and give the descendants the land of promise; the blessing would give them fame, enable them to flourish and prosper, and appoint them to bring others into the covenant blessings. The curse, meanwhile, would alienate, deprive, and disinherit people from the blessing. The effects of the curse are felt by the whole race as death and pain and as God’s judgment on the world.\nThese motifs continue throughout the Bible. Prophets and priests spoke of even greater blessings in the future and an even greater curse for those who refuse God’s gift of salvation and its blessings. The Bible reminds God’s people not to fear human beings, but to fear God, who has the power to bless and to curse.\nGood and Evil.  In Genesis, that which is good is blessed by God: It produces, enhances, preserves, and harmonizes with life. That which is evil is cursed: It causes pain, diverts from what is good, and impedes or destroys life. Genesis traces the perpetual struggle between good and evil that characterizes our fallen human race. God will bring about the greater good, build the faith of his people, and ultimately triumph over all evil (cp. Rom 8:28).\nGod’s Plan.  Genesis begins with the presupposition that God exists and that he has revealed himself in word and deed to Israel’s ancestors. It does not argue for the existence of God; it simply begins with God and shows how everything falls into place when the sovereign God works out his plan to establish Israel as the means of restoring blessing to the whole world.\nGod’s Rule.  Genesis is the fitting introduction to the founding of theocracy, the rule of God over all creation that was to be established through his chosen people. Genesis lays down the initial revelation of God’s sovereignty. He is the Lord of the universe who will move heaven and earth to bring about his plan. He desires to bless people, but he will not tolerate rebellion and unbelief. His promises are great, and he is fully able to bring them to fruition. To participate in his plan has always required faith, for without faith it is impossible to please him (Heb 11:6).",

    "content": "What does it mean to be in a relationship with God, the ultimate being in the universe? How does one establish that relationship? What is that relationship like, and what does it take to stay in it? These are questions that people around the world have been asking since the beginning of time. The book of Exodus provided the ancient Israelites with answers to such questions, revealing not only what was required of them in a relationship with God, but also what God had graciously done to make that relationship possible.\nSetting\nThe Exodus occurred sometime between 1450 and 1250 BC, when Egypt was arguably the greatest military and cultural power in the world. During Egypt’s 18th dynasty (1550–1295 BC) the pharaohs built an empire beyond Egypt’s borders, extending its control far into the north, up the Canaanite coast, and far to the south along the Nile. This imperial thrust seems to have fueled a megalomaniacal building program. As the house of the pharaoh grew in power, so the god of the royal house, Amon-Re, gained dominance. The land remained staunchly polytheistic, but worship of Amon-Re seems to have surpassed devotion to all other gods.\nIt was during this period that the Israelites departed from Egypt. God did not sneak his people out during a time of Egyptian weakness; he led them forth when Egyptian strength was at its height.\nSummary\nThe term exodus derives from the Greek word exodos, which means “the way out.” Exodus 1–15 is about the Hebrews’ “way out” of Egypt. The rest of Exodus (chs 16–40) reveals that the Hebrew people needed more than rescue from bondage in Egypt: They needed a way out of their sin and a way into fellowship with God. Exodus addresses Israel’s great needs: to be set free from bondage (chs 1–15), to know who God is and what he is like through the covenant at Sinai (chs 16–24), and to experience fellowship with God through the Tabernacle (chs 25–40). All of us have the same need to be set free, to know God, and to experience fellowship with him.\nAuthorship\nMoses is traditionally considered the author of the Pentateuch (Genesis—Deuteronomy), though many scholars call this into question. See Genesis Book Introduction, “Authorship.”\nThe Date of the Exodus (1446 or 1270 BC)\nThe date of Israel’s exodus from Egypt is the key question in determining Israel’s early chronology. The Bible’s focus on the sequence of events and their meanings rather than a strict chronology makes it difficult, however, to assign exact dates for the Exodus. A number of chronological indicators help point the way.\nFirst, according to 1 Kings 14:25-26, Pharaoh Shishak raided Judah in the fifth year of King Rehoboam’s reign. This date is known from sources outside the Bible to be 926 BC. Earlier dates in Israel’s history, such as the year Solomon began building the Temple (967 BC) and the date of the Exodus, are calculated by working backward from this fixed point and attempting to harmonize as much data as possible.\nA second chronological indicator for the date of the Exodus is the “new king” who “knew nothing about Joseph” (Exod 1:8). This comment most likely signals the arrival of a new dynasty. In the 1700s BC, foreigners from Asia began migrating to Egypt. In 1648 BC, one group of such foreigners, the Hyksos, invaded Lower Egypt and gained control of the region. Joseph and Jacob very likely entered Egypt (Gen 39; 46) shortly before or during the Hyksos period. The Hyksos ruled until 1540 BC, when Pharaoh Ahmose (1550–1525 BC) expelled them. Ahmose and the pharaohs who followed him were probably the dynasty described by Exodus 1:8.\nA third chronological indicator is the Merneptah Stela, an Egyptian monument dated to roughly 1209 BC, which mentions a clash with the Israelites in the southern part of Palestine. This is the first clear mention of Israel outside the Bible.\nThis evidence points to two possible scenarios for the date of the Exodus—an early date of about 1446 BC and a later date of about 1270 BC.\nEarly Exodus (about 1446 BC) The traditional scenario places the date of the Exodus around 1446 BC. According to 1 Kings 6:1, Solomon began construction of the Temple in the fourth year of his reign (967 BC), 480 years after the Exodus from Egypt. If the number 480 refers to calendar years, then the date of the Exodus was about 1446 BC, and Israel’s entry into Canaan was around 1406 BC. Archaeologists have discovered the Amarna letters, a cache of letters from Canaanite city chieftains asking Pharaoh Akhenaten (around 1352–1336 BC) to help them fight against certain rabble who were attacking them. This is a possible reference to the Israelites and would support the early dates for the Exodus and conquest. Additionally, in about 1100 BC Jephthah described Israel as having inhabited the Promised Land for 300 years (see Judg 11:26; cp. Num 21:21-35). The early date seems to fit best with the Bible’s own chronological information. A date near 1446 BC, therefore, has long been accepted.\nLate Exodus (about 1270 BC) The late Exodus scenario places the Exodus from Egypt approximately 300 years before the dedication of Solomon’s temple in 967 BC, early in the reign of Pharaoh Rameses II (1279–1213 BC). The city of Rameses, which the Israelites helped build (Exod 1:11), was named after this pharaoh, and there is evidence of significant construction activity dating to the early 1200s BC at the site. Additionally, archaeologists working in Palestine between World Wars I and II reported that they were unable to find any evidence of the conquest taking place in the early 1300s BC, as required by the early date. They did, however, claim to have found evidence of conquest and increased settlement activity in the late 1200s BC. If these findings are accurate and reflect Israelite activity in the Promised Land, they would support the idea that the Exodus occurred around 1270 BC. Those who opt for this later date contend that the number 480 in 1 Kings 6:1 is a symbolic number (12 generations times 40 years to symbolize a generation); in that case, the actual length of time would have been closer to 300 years (12 generations times 25 years, the approximate length of an actual generation).\nDates for the Patriarchs\nGenesis provides the relative ages of Israel’s patriarchs, Abraham to Joseph, but it does not fix absolute dates for their lives. Israel’s patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) were powerful family chiefs who moved from place to place. Unlike the leaders of empires who created permanent records, the patriarchs did not have palaces or libraries in which to deposit records. Also, the climate of Palestine is not favorable to the preservation of documents.\nThe date of the Exodus is therefore a key for calculating dates for the patriarchs. Calculations also take into account the lifespan of each patriarch; the chronological notations in Gen 12:4; 21:5; 25:26; 47:9 suggest that the patriarchs spent 215 years in Canaan.\nThe length of Israel’s stay in Egypt is an additional factor, and here there is a difference in texts. The Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) for Exodus 12:40 says that Israel spent 430 years in Egypt, from the year that Jacob entered Egypt to the year of Israel’s Exodus. However, the early Greek Old Testament translation (the Septuagint, or LXX) and the Samaritan Pentateuch (another significant manuscript) both say that the 430-year period mentioned in Exodus 12:40 includes the time the Israelites spent in both Canaan and Egypt (a chronology that Paul apparently followed; see Gal 3:17). This chronology would reduce the time spent in Egypt to 215 years. Various biblical statements that Israel was in Egypt for 400 years or four generations (Gen 15:13-16; cp. Exod 6:16-20; Num 3:17-19; 26:58-59; 1 Chr 6:1-3; Acts 7:6) could support the reading of either the Hebrew or the Greek text.\nFitting all the data together is challenging. While the dates of the Exodus or the patriarchs cannot be determined with absolute certainty, perhaps they were never intended to be. The biblical authors did not set out to provide a complete chronological record. What we do have is an excellent correlation between Israel’s historical records and those of the surrounding cultures.\nMeaning and Message\nThe opening chapters of Genesis depict a serious problem: God made the world and human beings for blessing (Gen 1:27-28), but the world fell under a curse. Humanity had become deeply corrupted (Gen 6:5), alienated from their Creator (Gen 3:23-24) and from one another (Gen 4:14). Death, violence, and confusion were rampant (Gen 4:8, 23-24; 11:9). Was there a way back to the blessing that God originally intended?\nIn Gen 12–50, God’s plan to restore the world begins to unfold. God chose Abraham and his descendants to be in a special covenant relationship with him, promising to make them into a prosperous nation through which the entire world would be blessed (Gen 12:1-3). Abraham believed God despite the fact that his wife seemed hopelessly barren (Gen 15:6), and God soon began to fulfill his promises (Gen 21:1-7).\nAs the book of Exodus begins, however, the validity of God’s promises to Abraham is in question. Yes, Abraham’s descendants had grown to a great number, but they were now slaves in Egypt, and Pharaoh, the mightiest king in the world, was committed to keeping them subjugated. As for the Promised Land, Abraham and his descendants had never actually owned any of it except for a burial plot (Gen 23). How would a group of slaves, slated to be absorbed into the Egyptian underclass, ever inherit the Promised Land and become a blessing to the world? Could God keep his promises? Did he even want to keep them? Did he really care for the Israelites, and did he even know what they were going through? Did the promises of Genesis have any real value?\nIn answering those questions, Exodus moves us far down the road to understanding who God is. God really does know our situation, and he values us. The Lord is in an altogether different category from “all other gods” (18:11). He is revealed in Exodus as the greatest being in existence (3:5-6, 14-15; 6:3), superior both to human kings who think of themselves as gods and to all the forces of nature. He is the one true God.\nThe people of Israel had spent some 400 years absorbing Egypt’s mistaken pagan beliefs. Now they would have to unlearn them: There are not many gods, only one. God is not the same as the natural world around them; he stands apart from the world, which he created. God cannot be manipulated by magic. Existence is not defined by an eternal struggle between positive and negative forces. God is holy, absolutely other, profoundly ethical in all of his relationships, passionately loyal to his creatures, and desiring to do good for them (34:5-6).\nGod used a covenant (Exod 19–23) to teach his people who he is and what their relationship with him should be like. The covenant teaches us God’s ethical nature. In the ancient world, ethics and religion were largely unrelated. By contrast, most of the requirements of God’s covenant have to do with how people treat one another (see 20:3-17). Those who are in a covenant relationship with God must treat one another ethically.\nGod rescues his people and calls us into a life of holiness in order that we may have a living, personal relationship with him. The Tabernacle chapters (25–40) are not an add-on; they are what the Exodus was all about. Yes, God would keep his promise of taking the people to the Promised Land, but his goal was for them to live in his presence without being destroyed by his holiness, and that is what happened (40:34-38). Salvation is not merely the forgiveness of sins. God’s goal for us is that, having been rescued from the bondage of sin, we might live daily in the glory of his presence and manifest his holy character.",

    "content": "Leviticus enabled ancient Israel to live in relationship with a holy God. But now that Christ has come as our High Priest and ultimate sacrifice—thereby fulfilling many of the requirements outlined in Leviticus—what do laws governing ancient Israel’s system of worship, with its priests and animal sacrifices, have to do with us? Leviticus increases our understanding of God’s holiness. And God’s demand for those who know him remains the same: “I am the Lord your God. . . . You must be holy because I am holy” (Lev 11:44-45; 1 Pet 1:15-16).\nSetting\nLeviticus continues the account of redemption that began with the promises made to Abraham (Gen 12, 15, 17) and the liberation of the Israelites from bondage in Egypt (Exod 1–15). The setting of Leviticus is the foot of Mount Sinai. The Israelites had not yet wandered in the wilderness or entered the Promised Land of Canaan. God had already established his covenant with Israel, declaring the Israelites to be his special treasure, royal priesthood, and chosen people (Exod 19:5-6). The people of Israel had received the Ten Commandments (Exod 20:1-17), the plans for the Tabernacle (Exod 25–27; 30:1-38), and the institution of the priesthood (Exod 28–29). The Tabernacle had been completed and dedicated (Exod 35–40). Now, in Leviticus, God spoke to Moses about his own holy nature, providing instructions about worship and conduct appropriate for Israel as his covenant people.\nSummary\nThe regulations in Leviticus deal primarily with the activities and responsibilities of the priestly tribe of Levi, especially the high priest (see Exod 28; Num 3:44–4:49). It includes God’s instructions about the Tabernacle, the priesthood, sacrifices, holy days, and ceremonial purity. Three main concerns are evident throughout Leviticus: the holiness of God, what is appropriate in worshiping a holy God, and how Israel was to be holy in relation to God.\nA proper relationship with God begins with knowing who God is and understanding his nature. Yet, finite human minds cannot fully comprehend God, the Eternal One. Worse, if left to our own intuition, we inevitably begin to worship idols rather than the true God. In Leviticus, God graciously reveals his holiness in tangible ways and instructs his people how to worship him acceptably. Each sacrifice and holy day teaches the Israelites about God and what he requires of them.\nGod calls Israel to know him and to love him (see Deut 6:5; 11:1). As a result, they will also love and serve one another (19:18, 33-34). The rituals and regulations revealed in Leviticus teach the Israelites how to integrate love and service into their lives, both as individuals and as a nation.\nAuthorship\nSome scholars believe that Leviticus was written during Israel’s exile in Babylon (about 586–539 BC), long after the time of Moses. This view, however, does not explain why Judaism during the Exile, which was increasingly oriented around the rabbi and the synagogue, would be concerned with the priesthood and the Tabernacle. Nor does it account for Israelite worship prior to the Exile, aside from the liturgy contained or implied in the Psalms.\nIt is likely that Moses wrote Leviticus during Israel’s time in the wilderness after the Exodus. Both Jewish tradition and the early Christian church identified Moses as the author of Leviticus. Moses, raised in the court of Egypt’s king, would have been skilled in reading, writing, and mathematics (see Acts 7:20-22) and quite capable of writing Leviticus. The book begins and ends with statements affirming that the contents of Leviticus were given to Israel by God through Moses (1:1-2; 27:34). Leviticus repeatedly describes how Moses received the Lord’s instructions (e.g., 4:1; 5:14; 6:1, 8, 19, 24; 7:22, 28; 8:1) and carried them out (8:4–10:20). The Old Testament often refers to Moses as the author of the Pentateuch (Genesis—Deuteronomy; see Josh 8:31-32; 23:6; 1 Kgs 2:3; 2 Kgs 14:6; 23:25; 2 Chr 23:18; 30:16; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Neh 8:1; Dan 9:11-13). The New Testament does the same (Matt 19:7-8; Luke 2:22; 24:44; John 7:19, 23; Rom 10:5; 1 Cor 9:9; Heb 10:28). See also Genesis Book Introduction, “Authorship.”\nMeaning and Message\nAlthough it is set in an ancient time and culture, Leviticus communicates a timeless and vibrant message: God is holy, and he expects his people, whom he has rescued, to be holy like he is. God’s holiness and his gracious redemption provide both the foundation and the motivation for his people’s own holiness (11:44-45).\nThe priests stood between God and the people as mediators of the covenant. The priests interpreted what was holy and how holiness should be expressed in the community. The atoning sacrifices provided the way for the people to have their sins forgiven and to be made right with God (atonement). The non-atoning sacrifices celebrated the people’s relationship with God through gifts and shared meals. While surrounding nations offered sacrifices to their gods to appease them and gain their favor, Israel’s worship was not designed to manipulate God. Rather, the worship prepared and purified the people so that they could approach God. Each of the laws, ceremonies, and holy days teaches that God is holy and that he expects his people to be holy (Lev 11:44-45; 19:2; see 1 Cor 3:17; 1 Pet 1:15).\nForgiveness of sin and reconciliation to God directly relate to how people treat one another. Concern for social justice pervades Leviticus, which sets forth obligations to one’s neighbor, to the poor, and to foreigners. God expects those in covenant with him to love each other as an expression of his love (cp. Matt 22:39; Mark 12:31; Luke 10:27; Rom 13:9; Gal 5:14; Jas 2:8).",

    "content": "The book of Numbers tells the story of Israel in the wilderness, journeying toward the Promised Land from Mount Sinai. As Moses led Israel from Egypt to Canaan, God tested his people in the crucible of the wilderness to see if they would be faithful to him as a unified nation. Numbers documents their successes and failures. Israel’s disobedience resulted in the Lord’s judgment, always counterbalanced by his patient persistence in raising a new generation to fulfill his plan. With its many stories and the detailed exposition of God’s laws, Numbers gives us a dramatic account of the Lord’s nature, his covenant, and his plan for his people.\nSetting\nAfter leaving Egypt, the Israelites journeyed to Mount Sinai, where God gave them the law (see Exodus). They remained at Sinai for a year before traveling through the wilderness into Transjordan (the region east of the Jordan River) to camp on the plains of Moab. God tested Israel in the wilderness as the generation that made the exodus from Egypt passed away and a new generation prepared to enter the Promised Land. The book of Numbers instructed the new generation camped on the plains of Moab to obey the Lord.\nIsrael was shaped and purified during this wilderness sojourn. Through Moses’ literary efforts (and those of later scribes and editors), Numbers enabled successive generations to hear that story. It thus became a vital component of Hebrew memory. Numbers was written so that those who learned from history need not repeat mistakes from the past.\nSummary\nThe book of Numbers gets its structure from the three stages of Israel’s journey through the wilderness: (1) the nineteen days in which Israel prepared to depart from Mount Sinai (1:1–10:10), (2) the thirty-nine-year journey from Sinai to the plains of Moab (10:11–22:1), and (3) the final months of Israel’s encampment on the plains of Moab shortly before they entered Canaan (21:1–36:13).\nThe two registrations of Israel’s men of military age (chs 1–4, 26) also shape Numbers. These registrations primarily measured the strength of Israel’s fighting force and the number of Levites, with the totals at the beginning of the book and toward the end of the book representing two completely different generations. The first census tallied the rebellious generation that left Egypt, received the law at Sinai, and died in the wilderness. The second registration numbered the new generation of Israelites that entered the Promised Land. The two counts are very close, showing that the second generation completely replaced the first.\nAlong the way, the Hebrews that left Egypt repeatedly rebelled (chs 11, 12, 14, 16–17, 20, 25). They all died in the wilderness except for Joshua and Caleb, whose faith was exemplary (13:30; 14:6-9).\nIsrael’s army was tested on several occasions before they entered Canaan (chs 14, 21, 31), and the story of Balaam is recounted (chs 22–24). Arrangements were made for settling Transjordan (ch 32), the wilderness journey was reviewed (ch 33), and Moses anticipated the occupation of Canaan (chs 34–36).\nNumbers is a case study in how Israel maintained—and failed to maintain—covenant regulations in their day-to-day experiences.\nAuthorship\nAs with the other books of the Pentateuch, Moses has traditionally been recognized as the author of Numbers. Until the advent of modern scholarship, both Jewish and Christian scholars held to Moses’ authorship; the Old Testament, the New Testament, and much ancient Jewish literature also made this assumption. References to Moses’ role as author occur throughout the Pentateuch (e.g., Num 33:1-2). There is no need to exclude Moses out of hand as the primary author—on the basis of content or the level of literacy feasible at the time of the Exodus and conquest—except in passages such as the account of his death (Deut 34). It is also possible that Moses supervised the compilation of books credited to him or, like the apostle Paul, dictated parts of his writings.\nMany scholars postulate various sources from which later editors created the books of the Pentateuch, but this “Documentary Hypothesis” remains speculative (see Genesis Book Introduction, “Authorship”). Even allowing for later modifications by scribes and editors, Numbers substantially represents itself as Moses’ work.\nDate and Geography\nThe geographical, cultural, and linguistic data related to Numbers fit either an early date or a late date (1400s or 1200s BC) for the Exodus and conquest (see Exodus Book Introduction, “The Date of the Exodus”).\nThe archaeological evidence from Sinai, the Negev, and Transjordan (Edom, Moab, and Ammon) also contributes significantly to discussion about the historical background of the conquest. Scholars are unable to identify exact locations for many place-names mentioned in the wilderness itinerary, and there are problems with various other sites named in Numbers.\nLiterary Issues\nTitle of the Book.  The name “Numbers” derives from this book’s interest in statistics (see chs 1–4, 26). This title is the English translation of the Latin title Numeri and the Greek Arithmoi, the names given to this book by the Latin Vulgate and Greek Septuagint translations of the Old Testament. The registration accounts show with mathematical precision that the Israelites who left Egypt were not the same people who crossed the Jordan into Canaan. In the Hebrew Bible, the book of Numbers is called bemidbar (“in the wilderness”), the fourth word of Num 1:1 in the Hebrew text. This title is certainly appropriate, since it reflects the book’s geographical setting and chronological framework.\nLiterary Genres.  The book of Numbers includes a variety of common literary genres, such as narrative (e.g., 10:11–14:45), poetry (e.g., chs 23–24), and law (e.g., chs 4–6). It also contains detailed lists of facts and figures, such as registration tallies (e.g., chs 1–4), offerings (e.g., ch 7), and travel itineraries (e.g., ch 33). The NLT compiles various prose lists into concise tables of names and numbers (chs 1–2; 13, 34).\nLiterary Sources.  The Hebrew Bible identifies ancient sources that Moses (and perhaps later editors) consulted, such as The Book of the Wars of the Lord (21:14-15), the “Song of the Well” (21:17-18), and the “Song of Heshbon” (21:27-30). Chapters 23–24 contain many poetic lines from the non-Israelite prophet Balaam; 31:32-47 seems to be based on an actual record of war spoils; and chapter 33 appears to derive from a written diary.\nText.  The Hebrew text of Numbers is very well preserved, except for a few sections of poetry in chapters 21–24 that are difficult to interpret. The generally good condition of the Hebrew text is evident when comparing the Hebrew Masoretic Text (AD 900s) with much earlier fragments of Numbers found in the Dead Sea Scrolls (150 BC—AD 125); there are only a few insignificant variations between the two. Greater differences exist between the Masoretic Text, equivalent sections in the Greek Old Testament (the Septuagint), and the Samaritan Pentateuch, but they represent deliberate differences of interpretation, not just variant readings of the manuscripts.\nMeaning and Message\nNumbers explains how God provided for his people’s needs, and it documents the Israelites’ repeated disobedience as they rebelled against the Lord’s commands. The Israelites did not wander in the wilderness for forty years because they were lost, but because of their faithlessness and rebellion.\nNumbers highlights Israel’s struggle with God. As often as God called the Israelites to adhere to the law, they disobeyed him. The Israelites could count on God’s provision for their physical necessities and for guidance and instruction through their chosen leaders. Yet God’s constant provision was often met with lack of faith. Numbers illustrates the swift judgment of a holy God, while teaching that the Lord is faithful and patient.\nAs in ancient Israel, all communities of believers need unwavering leadership, and Numbers continues to warn those who too easily forget God’s holy nature. Specific episodes from Numbers are used in the New Testament as powerful object lessons:\n•In 1 Corinthians 10:1-11, the apostle Paul warns his readers to avoid idolatry, immorality, and grumbling so that they will not perish like the Israelites in the wilderness. God is not pleased with such behavior, and followers of Christ must not put God to the test (1 Cor 10:9).\n•The author of Hebrews identifies repeated instances of Israel’s hardhearted and disobedient spirit and says that God responded to this waywardness with swift and certain wrath (Heb 3:7–4:11). These verses, which draw heavily on the language of Psalm 95, are saturated with terms that reflect God’s judgment of Israel’s sin.\n•Jude 1:5 teaches Christians about faithfulness by summarizing Numbers.\nThe same God who liberated his people from Egypt destroyed that rebellious generation because they did not believe and obey. Like ancient Israel, Christians must learn from the mistakes of the past and live in faith and obedience to their Lord.",

    "content": "God first revealed Israel’s national “constitution” to Moses at Sinai (Exod 20–23). The great leader Moses was now about to die. God had appointed a younger man, Joshua, to replace Moses, but he was not yet fully tested. Israel had been rescued from slavery in Egypt and miraculously preserved through forty years of wandering in the wilderness. The Israelites now stood on the verge of entering the land promised to them, but it was inhabited by powerful and hostile enemies. Although God had been faithful in the past, the future seemed uncertain. Deuteronomy is the account of Israel’s covenant with God renewed—a covenant that would guide Israel to God’s blessings throughout the remainder of their history as a nation.\nSetting\nForty years after their exodus from Egypt, the Israelites arrived at the plains of Moab, just across the Jordan River from Jericho. After four decades of wandering, they were poised to cross the Jordan, conquer the Canaanite nations, and settle their land in fulfillment of God’s promises to Abraham. First, however, God would renew his covenant with them.\nMoses was aware that he would die before leading his people to their destination. So, prior to his death, he needed to remind the people of the terms of the covenant that God had revealed to him. The initial covenant, suitable for Israel while en route to Canaan, had been made thirty-eight years earlier at Sinai (Exod 19–24). Now, in anticipation of Israel’s establishment as a settled community, the original covenant must be restated and enlarged. The book of Deuteronomy is this restatement.\nSummary\nDeuteronomy is Moses’ farewell address to the tribes of Israel. The book includes narratives, exhortations, warnings, instructions, and promises of blessings or curses in relation to Israel’s faithfulness. Deuteronomy is composed as a treaty text, using elements common to covenants between nations. It is similar to other treaties known from ancient Near Eastern sources, particularly from Hittite archives. Moses thus communicates God’s purposes to Israel in a familiar literary and legal form.\nThe formal structures of Deuteronomy yield a great deal of insight into the theological nature of the book. As a covenant text, it underscores the seriousness of God’s promises and of Israel’s need (as the covenant partner) to obey the terms of the treaty so that God can fulfill his promises. As a farewell speech, it is rooted in a historical and geographical setting.\nThe following outline reflects the analysis of Deuteronomy as a covenant document:\n1:1-5 Preamble to the covenant\n1:6–4:49 Historical prologue\n5:1–26:15 Stipulations of the covenant\n26:16–29:1 Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\n29:2–30:20 Review of the covenant and choice between life and death\n31:1-29 Deposit of the text of the covenant\n31:30–32:43 Witnesses of the covenant\nThe outline embedded in the Bible text reflects Deuteronomy’s structure both as a covenant text and as a farewell speech communicated in a series of sermons.\nAuthorship\nLong-standing Jewish and Christian tradition holds that Moses wrote Deuteronomy. Both the Old Testament and New Testament acknowledge Moses’ authorship of the book (see 1 Kgs 2:3; 2 Kgs 14:6; 2 Chr 25:4; Ezra 3:2; Matt 19:7; Mark 12:19; Luke 20:28; Acts 3:22-23; Rom 10:19; 1 Cor 9:9).\nHowever, during the past two hundred years, critical scholars have denied that Moses wrote Deuteronomy. Some scholars identify Deuteronomy as the scroll found in the Temple in King Josiah’s time (around 621 BC; see 2 Kgs 22:8-20) and argue that Deuteronomy should be dated in close proximity to that time. Some also attribute editorial additions as late as the period following the Exile (538 BC and later).\nArchaeologists have discovered Hittite treaty texts originating in the Late Bronze Age (1500–1200 BC), around the time of Moses. These texts, which contain a number of similarities to Deuteronomy, provide support for an early authorship of the book. Some scholars compare Deuteronomy to seventh-century Assyrian treaty texts that are closer to Josiah’s time. However, the Hittite texts are more similar to Deuteronomy in structure and content than the Assyrian examples, making it less likely that Deuteronomy was written during the later period.\nIn short, the traditional viewpoint that Moses authored the majority of the book is a reasonable conclusion. Certain editorial additions were included later (e.g., the account of Moses’ death; 34:5-12). See further Genesis Book Introduction, “Authorship.”\nLiterary Form\nDeuteronomy’s structure resembles other treaty texts drawn up between various nations in the period of the Exodus and the conquest. Some of these were treaties between equals, while others were suzerain-vassal treaties. In a suzerain-vassal treaty, the superior party (the suzerain, or “great king”) would make demands of and offer promises to subject peoples (the vassals) in return for their unqualified obedience.\nDeuteronomy is a suzerain-vassal treaty between God and Israel. God called the Israelites out of bondage in Egypt to be his servant people. He took the lead in the relationship, determined the terms for maintaining the treaty, and offered promises of blessing if Israel obeyed and judgment if the nation disobeyed.\nMoses’ use of the suzerain-vassal treaty format makes it clear that Deuteronomy is a covenant text. God chose Israel to be his special people. It was not the covenant that made them so, for they were already identified as God’s people before the Exodus (Exod 4:22-23). Rather, the text of the covenant regulated their behavior. By reviewing the covenant with this generation of Israelites, Moses ensured that they would enter the Promised Land as God’s covenant people.\nMeaning and Message\nThe covenant is the leading theme of Deuteronomy—and perhaps of the entire Old Testament. The covenant provided the means for the Lord to unite himself to Israel. The covenant stated that the Lord was Israel’s God, Israel was God’s people, and the relationship between them would achieve God’s redemptive purposes. This awesome privilege also included profound responsibility. Could Israel conduct itself in a manner that would guarantee the success of its mission? What standards of behavior would enable them to fulfill their calling?\nIsrael had the freedom to accept or reject God’s covenant (Exod 19:7-8). Once they accepted it, the distribution of blessings and curses, as outlined within the covenant, depended on whether they obeyed or disobeyed (28:1-6, 15-19). Yet even disobedience could be overcome if the nation would repent, return, and be restored to covenant fellowship (30:1-10; see also Lev 26:40-45).\nThis covenant did not make Israel God’s people; God’s promise of a national offspring to Abraham had already done that (Gen 17:1-8). The covenant made at Sinai gave Israel the privilege of serving the Lord as a kingdom of priests (Exod 19:4-6). Deuteronomy reiterates the terms and conditions of that covenant: If Israel could remain faithful in its role as a “kingdom of priests and [God’s] holy nation,” it would direct God’s blessings to the whole world.\nThe Israelites were the unique people of God. God made promises to the nation’s forefathers that he fulfilled in the Exodus and in creating the nation. He was ready to solidify Israel in the conquest of the Promised Land and move the nation forward until his purposes were complete. The book of Deuteronomy established the principles of faithful life and ministry that would ensure Israel’s ongoing relationship with God in achieving those objectives. Israel had the indescribable honor of partnering with Almighty God to bring about his plan for the ages.",

    "content": "The account of Israel’s soldiers walking around Jericho until its walls came tumbling down is one of the most famous in the Bible. Joshua had served as Moses’ apprentice, so when God appointed Joshua as Israel’s leader, he was ready. He led the Israelites across the Jordan River and through two campaigns that enabled them to settle the hill country of Canaan. As they began to live there, Joshua divided the land among Israel’s twelve tribes. The book of Joshua reveals much about God: He judges sin and faithfully keeps his promises.\nSetting\nWhen Israel was in Egypt, they were enslaved by a nation that was the most powerful, prosperous, and secure on earth. But God intervened on Israel’s behalf, and Egypt was devastated. The Israelites then spent forty years in the wilderness because they refused to believe that God could do for them in Canaan what he had already done in bringing them out of Egypt. The disbelieving generation died and a new generation came of age. The new generation believed God’s promises and was ready to invade the land of Canaan.\nAncient Canaan was subdivided by geographical features into four narrow north–south strips. (1) To the east of the Jordan River was the plateau of Transjordan (the land “across the Jordan”). (2) Westward, the land drops steeply into the deep cut of the Jordan River valley. The deepest dry point of this valley, the shore of the Dead Sea, marks the lowest dry land on the surface of the earth. (3) The central hill country runs from the mountains and hills of Galilee in the north to the Negev in the south. (4) The Coastal Plain lies along the Mediterranean Sea, interrupted near its northern end by the ridge of Mount Carmel that juts into the sea. In the narrative of Joshua, Israel began at Acacia Grove in Transjordan, crossed the Jordan River, conquered Jericho and the central hill country, and took up settlements in the regions that had been cleared.\nMuch of Canaan was organized into small city-states, each with its own king. These city-states were grouped in ever-shifting coalitions. The assembling of a southern and then a northern coalition against the invading Israelites was as close to total unity as these city-states ever came. However, even these coalitions were not enough to save the Canaanites.\nSummary\nThe first half of Joshua (chs 1–12) is among the most dramatic narratives in the Bible. In preparing Israel to cross the Jordan, Joshua sent two young men to scout out Jericho, a town Israel would have to conquer in order to enter the hill country. The young scouts were aided by a woman named Rahab, and they promised to spare her and her family in return for her help (ch 2). The Israelites crossed the Jordan River, the flow of which had been miraculously halted (ch 3). Then God gave Israel the city of Jericho by causing its walls to fall (ch 6).\nPossession of Jericho opened the routes that ascended westward into the hill country. But a man named Achan disobeyed God’s instructions, displeasing the Lord, and Israel suffered a setback before Achan’s sin was discovered and judged (ch 7). God then gave Joshua a resounding victory over the hastily gathered coalition of southern Canaanite city-states; God even granted Joshua’s request for the sun and moon to stand still until the victory was complete (ch 10). Joshua then turned northward, where he gained a similarly decisive victory over a northern coalition of city-states (ch 11). The entire hill country, from the Negev in the south to Upper Galilee in the north, now lay open for Israelite settlement.\nThe second half of Joshua (chs 13–24) contains the informative account of the allotment of Israel’s territory, including detailed descriptions of the territories given to Judah, Benjamin, and Joseph (chs 15–19); these tribes became the central tribes of Israel. Caleb’s and Joshua’s inheritances begin and end this section of territorial allotments (chs 15 and 19). The designation of six cities of refuge (ch 20) and the assignment of towns to the Levites within each tribal territory (ch 21) complete the process of allotting the land to the tribes. The 2½ tribes given land on the east side of the Jordan River were released to return home, but they had to clear up a misunderstanding with the western tribes about the building of a memorial (ch 22). The book concludes with Joshua’s farewell (ch 23), his convening of the people to renew their covenant with God, and three prominent funerals (ch 24).\nAuthor and Date\nNowhere does the book of Joshua claim that Joshua was its author. Both the frequent occurrence of the phrase “to this day” and the reference to The Book of Jasharthe book of Jasher as a source for Joshua indicate that the book was written after Joshua’s death. Yet the occurrence of the pronoun “we” in portions of the narrative provides evidence that at least some of the book is based on personal recollections of Joshua and of those under his command. It is likely that the book of Joshua existed in more or less its present form no later than Israel’s early monarchy (the time of David and Solomon). The human author or authors of Joshua remain anonymous.\nJoshua as History\nIn the last two centuries, some scholars have attempted to discredit the historical validity of Joshua by arguing that Transjordan (the area east of the Jordan River) and the cities of Jericho and Ai were not occupied when Israel entered Canaan, so Israel could not have conquered them. However, archaeological surveys show that Transjordan was occupied when Israel entered Canaan and that Jericho was indeed destroyed as Joshua describes.\nOther scholars argue that accounts having an explanatory purpose (such as those explaining the origin of a name) cannot be historical. However, although some explanatory accounts found in ancient texts are mythical or false, many others are historically accurate. The content of the book of Joshua was probably first written down near the time of the events it includes. It shows every indication of being historically accurate, even though it does not answer every historical question readers might bring to it.\nFor most of the time that it has been part of the Scriptures, the book of Joshua has been regarded as reliable history. The books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings stand in contrast with the epic, mythical, and royal self-congratulatory literature produced by surrounding cultures. These biblical books provide a selective history of ancient Israel in the land where God placed them. And they were written from a prophetic perspective—from the same point of view as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve Minor Prophets—which regarded Israel as living in a covenant relationship with God.\nJoshua thus records only the broad outlines of Israel’s entry into Canaan. The book of Joshua neither states nor implies that Israel destroyed all of the Canaanites and their cities. Many Canaanites remained, as the following book of Judges also makes clear. The multi-generation history of Israel recorded in Judges shows that Israel gradually became stronger and absorbed the Canaanites. By the time of King David, most people of the land regarded themselves as Israelites, although some distinct groups still remained (e.g., 2 Sam 5:6-8).\nMeaning and Message\nThe book of Joshua emphasizes the fulfillment of God’s covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The patriarchs had traversed the land as resident aliens; now their descendants occupied it as the beneficiaries of God’s faithfulness to his promise. Even the burials at the close of the book emphasize that point. Whereas Abraham had to buy a small parcel of land to bury Sarah, now Joseph, Joshua, and Eleazar were honored with burials in the territory God had given to their descendants.\nThe book of Joshua demonstrates that God speaks and acts with integrity and that he can be trusted to fulfill his promises. The book conveys this message in both subtle and obvious ways. The scouts’ faithfulness to Rahab and her family reflects and affirms the faithfulness of the God who had brought them to her house. The giving of Caleb’s inheritance at the beginning of the tribal allotments and the giving of Joshua’s at the end bear testimony to God’s recognition of those who remain faithful to him throughout their lifetime. Joshua also records that Israel constructed stone memorials throughout the country. These monuments served as visual aids to teach generations of Israelite children about God’s absolute faithfulness. These stone monuments eventually crumbled or were carried away for other uses, but the book of Joshua itself remains as an enduring memorial, still giving testimony of God’s goodness and faithfulness.\nThe book of Joshua also records some disturbing events. Israel destroyed Jericho and Ai and all their people. Many Israelites, including Achan and his family, died because of Achan’s sin. God fought the Canaanite coalitions that tried to prevent Israel from establishing themselves in the land. These and other episodes remind readers of the deadly seriousness of sin.\nIn a culture where women and their rights were held with little or no regard, Joshua records a different perspective. When the land was allocated among the clans of Manasseh, the daughters of Zelophehad received their father’s inheritance, as God had instructed. Rahab’s saving of the two young scouts in the dramatic opening episode of the book also provides a radically positive assessment of a woman’s place in God’s economy.\nThe book of Joshua has much for contemporary readers to ponder about God himself, the consequences of human good and evil, and God’s passionate commitment to human redemption and the restoration of the divine-human relationship.",

    "content": "The book of Judges tells the stories of the inspired leaders who rescued Israel from their enemies time after time. During this period, the people were frequently unfaithful to God’s covenant, and God allowed their enemies to oppress them. Israel repeatedly turned to the Lord for help, and the Lord repeatedly sent charismatic judges to deliver Israel. These powerful leaders did amazing things, but they were unable to transcend Israel’s anarchy and lawlessness. Israel needed a leader whose authority could give them national coherence and unity.\nSetting\nThe period of the judges is best understood against the backdrop of its own age. Historians and sociologists have compared the book of Judges with the epics of Homer, the sagas of old Iceland, and the French La Chanson de Roland, each of which represents the “Heroic Age” in a civilization’s adolescence. During the times described in these works, unorthodox men and women marched to a different drum, exhibiting behavior at odds with accepted norms yet accomplishing great things.\nAfter Moses died, the Israelites’ campaigns under Joshua provided the desert nomads with a settled land, but hardly a settled society. That would take hundreds of years and the emergence of a stable monarchy under King David. But Moses and Joshua did leave the Israelites with an organized society. According to the biblical text, the tribal structure was well established and the lands were clearly apportioned. A few central shrines (e.g., Gilgal and Shiloh) had emerged, and leaders such as priests, Levites, and tribal elders brought Israel a degree of order. The people continued to remember the old traditions—the covenant promise to Abraham, the sojourn in Egypt from which Israel had been rescued by divine strength, the desert wanderings, and the ratification of the covenant. But something was still lacking.\nAccording to Judges, Israel’s shortcomings had two sources. First, the prologues (1:1–2:5 and 2:6–3:6) explain that the tribes failed to possess their allotted territories because they capitulated to the norms of Canaan rather than adhering to the divine covenant given under Moses. The second issue looms large in the epilogues (chs 17–21) and is summarized in the repeated sentence “In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes” (17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25). The prologues highlight Israel’s unfaithfulness to God; the epilogues are concerned with a failed social structure. The age of heroes could not produce the stable political institutions required for implementing God’s rule over the children of Israel.\nThe book of Judges does not, however, reject the principle of charismatic leadership embodied in the judges. The judges’ inspiration came at God’s initiative and fulfilled God’s purpose in leading and saving Israel (see 2:16-19). The stories celebrate the principle of heroic leadership, making it clear that the Achilles’ heel of the era was not in the divinely inspired leaders but in the sinfulness of the people’s hearts, which, as suggested by the book of Judges, had to be addressed by a different form of governance.\nSummary\nJudges follows an A-B-A structure, beginning with two prologues. Each is introduced by the death of Joshua—a pivotal event in Israel’s national life—thus picking up the narrative from Joshua 24:28-31. The first prologue (Judg 1:1–2:5) recalls the failures of individual tribes to follow through on God’s covenant. By contenting themselves with partial occupation of the land, they demonstrated their disregard for the Lord’s promise and provoked the withdrawal of his protection (2:1-3).\nThe second prologue (2:6–3:6) turns from the failures of the tribes to introduce the individuals whom the Lord used to keep the flame of conquest and settlement alive in a chaotic time. The story moves from Joshua to the elders who outlived him but had experienced God’s power in the wilderness and conquest, and finally to the third generation “who did not acknowledge the Lord or remember the mighty things he had done for Israel” (2:10). The account then introduces the central feature of the book, the judges whom God raised up to rescue Israel and call them back to covenant obedience (2:16), the evidence of which would be faithful occupation of the Promised Land. Judges 3:1-6, like the close of the earlier prologue, informs readers in advance that the effort will end in failure.\nThe central section (3:7–16:31) contains a series of “cycles”—longer accounts of the six major judges (Othniel, Ehud, Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson) and shorter accounts of the six minor judges (Shamgar, Tola, Jair, Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon). This section includes the rise of an anti-charismatic leader, Abimelech (ch 9), whose rule was like that of a king. Following Abimelech, the spiral is clearly downward. The figures at the beginning of the story are more ideal (Othniel to Gideon), while the characters toward the end are more questionable (Jephthah, Samson). In all, there were twelve judges, apparently representing each of the twelve tribes of Israel (see study note on 12:8). The inexorable march toward chaos throughout the book points to their need for a more centralized society.\nJudges culminates in two epilogues (chs 17–18; 19–21) that highlight the historical and theological failure of Israel under the judges, and the ensuing spiritual and social chaos. The epilogues are marked by the summary refrain, “In those days Israel had no king,” to which is twice added, “all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes” (see 17:6; 18:1; 19:1; 21:25). This conclusion begs for a sequel in which a new approach to leadership reverses the declining effectiveness of individual charismatic leaders.\nAuthors and Date of Composition\nNothing is known about the author(s) or compiler(s) of Judges. The historical books (Joshua—2 Kings) are a connected narrative. Tradition tells us that various sources were combined into a theological narrative under the influence of Israel’s prophetic schools.\nEvidence from the last chapter of this history (2 Kgs 25:27-30) suggests the exile to Babylon as a final date for the composition or collection of this material. Judges may have received its final form at the same time, although there is little in the book of Judges itself that points beyond the early monarchy. Judges knows nothing of a central shrine or national capital in Jerusalem; the social structures reflected in the book indicate a nation still struggling with issues of settlement and governance.\nChronology of the Judges\nOne long-standing question has been how to fit the accounts of the judges into the chronology of the period from Joshua to Saul. Dating and ordering the judges is notoriously difficult; the results depend to a great extent on whether the Exodus is seen as having occurred in the 1400s or in the 1200s BC. The longer chronology (based on an earlier date for the Exodus) harmonizes well with Judges 11:26 and 1 Kings 6:1. The shorter chronology (based on a later date for the Exodus) seems to fit better with external evidence (such as archaeological findings), but it forces the period of the judges into a relatively short time frame.\nThe people of Israel entered the Promised Land of Canaan in either 1406 or 1230 BC, depending on the date of the Exodus (see Exodus Book Introduction, “The Date of the Exodus”). The people of Israel then lived in the land and experienced cycles of oppression by neighboring countries and rescue through various judges until the prophet Samuel anointed Saul as king of all Israel around 1050 BC.\nThe accounts of the judges themselves are told as a sequence, giving the impression that one judge followed another. Most of the accounts of the judges also provide chronological indications, specifying how long oppressors dominated God’s people and the period of peace that followed their rescue by each judge. However, simply adding these numbers produces a sum of years that significantly exceeds the time available in this period of history.\nA solution to this difficulty is to realize that the judges did not always work sequentially but sometimes overlapped with one another. For example, Judges 10:7 states, “So the Lord burned with anger against Israel, and he turned them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites.” It follows that Jephthah freed his people from the Ammonite threat in the northeast while Samson began to rescue Israel from Philistia in the southwest.\nIn certain cases, the text does point to a sequence between judges. For instance, Shamgar judged “after Ehud” (3:31) and Deborah “after Ehud’s death” (4:1; see also 5:6). Nonetheless, Judges does not provide these types of connections between most of the judges, and most of the judges held influence over only a limited part of the land of Israel. The period of the judges was characterized not only by moral depravity and spiritual darkness, but also by political fragmentation. None of the judges had a national following—each was followed by only a few tribes at most, usually those in the vicinity of the judge’s hometown.\nWhen we realize that the judges were local and that their time periods often overlapped, we can conclude that the period of the judges thus fits into history.\nMeaning and Message\nWhat kind of leadership does God’s work require, and where can God’s people find such leaders? Judges gives a partial answer to both questions but stops short of providing the final word.\nJudges celebrates charismatic (gifted, inspired) leadership while recognizing its limitations. One enduring biblical principle of leadership is that God raises up heroes and fills them with his Spirit to rescue his people. Moses and Joshua had been such rescuer-leaders, and Saul and David would be as well. The heroes of Judges had flaws, but God used them nonetheless. A true charismatic leader is a man or woman who is given a divine gift (Greek charisma) that equips for the task.\nA second kind of leadership, often called “official,” has authority that does not come directly from God but flows from an office or appointment. While the Israelite judges were classic charismatic leaders, the kings represented official authority in the military and political sphere. Prophets and priests often presented the same contrast in Israel’s spiritual life—generally speaking, the prophets were inspired leaders while the priests were official leaders.\nWhich type of leader has God’s approval? How do those who want to follow the Lord faithfully know which structures of leadership are worthy of obedience? The book of Judges demonstrates God’s unmistakable commitment to raise up powerfully endowed, spirit-filled leaders appropriate for the occasion. The practice of charismatic leadership, despite its limitations, is never set aside in biblical narrative.\nEven in the transition to kingship in 1 and 2 Samuel, there is ambivalence toward the new form of official leadership. Kingship began with Saul, a charismatic judge-king in whom the weaknesses of both systems combined to bring about his downfall. Charismatic leadership is then affirmed and renewed in the life of David, a great hero-king. David was so distinctly a charismatic king that it is initially difficult to distinguish him from a successful judge. What answers the plaintive cry of Judges is not the rejection of charismatic leaders but the addition of God’s covenant with his chosen king, David (2 Sam 7:1-29). God’s ideal is in the combination of inspired and official leadership. Israel’s judges and kings, with all their limitations, look forward to Jesus, the perfect charismatic king, who combines in his person the qualities lacking in each of his predecessors.",

    "content": "Ruth was a dedicated daughter-in-law to Naomi, her bereaved mother-in-law. Boaz was the kindly owner of a busy farm and a close relative of Naomi. In this story, there is loss and loyalty, a homecoming, a secret midnight meeting, a public transfer of property, a marriage, and a child. The book of Ruth tells a tale of God’s love in the lives of ordinary people.\nSetting\nThe events in Ruth took place around 1100 BC, during the period of the judges. Whereas the book of Judges records violent, momentous events, Ruth shows a peaceful, ordinary side of life at the time.\nDuring this period, Israel had few political structures. The average person focused more on tribal and clan ties than on national identity. Most families in Israel depended on their own crops and animals for food and for other necessities. Israel’s hill country was fertile, but the water supply was variable, and a couple years of low rainfall could cause famine.\nSummary\nWhen famine came to Bethlehem, Elimelech moved to Moab with his wife, Naomi, and their two sons, who married Moabite women. Elimelech died in Moab, then the young men also died, leaving Naomi destitute. Hearing that the famine in Bethlehem had ended, Naomi decided to return home. Ruth, one of Naomi’s Moabite daughters-in-law, declared her loyalty to Naomi. The two of them set out together and arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the spring barley harvest. To obtain food for the coming year, Ruth went out to glean, beginning in Boaz’s field. When he learned who she was, Boaz instructed his workers to be generous to Ruth.\nHearing of Boaz’s kindness, Naomi sent Ruth to the threshing floor one night to meet him privately. Ruth asked Boaz to act as her family redeemer—which would include marrying her. Boaz knew that a closer relative had the first right to act as family redeemer, but Boaz promised to do so if that man refused. He went to the town gate to arrange the matter, and the other man declined. So Boaz married Ruth, who bore a son named Obed.\nHaving a grandson guaranteed Naomi’s security in old age and brought back what she thought she had lost forever. Obed became the grandfather of David, Israel’s greatest king. The book of Ruth ends with a genealogy of ten generations, from Perez, the son of Judah, to David.\nAuthorship and Date\nSome biblical scholars have questioned the historicity of Ruth and proposed that it might be fictional. As biblical scholars discover more about ancient history, ancient writing conventions, and everyday life in the ancient Near East, however, we can readily conclude that Ruth and other accounts from Israel’s early periods are firmly grounded in history. We don’t know who wrote Ruth, and archaeologists may never recover direct physical evidence of Ruth, Boaz, and Naomi, but the account reflects its time and place in a way that supports its historicity.\nMeaning and Message\nGod usually works in the ordinary events of everyday life. Miracles do happen, but God regularly accomplishes his purposes and blesses his people through routine occurrences. If we learn faithfulness in the everyday, we are equipped to be faithful when crises come.\nRuth contains a number of spoken blessings. God’s people have the privilege of blessing each other in God’s name. We often help fulfill those blessings, as Naomi and Boaz fulfilled the blessings they gave to Ruth.\nNaomi felt abandoned by God; but God had not abandoned Naomi, and by the end of the book Naomi knew that God had restored more to her than she could have dreamed. God is trustworthy in our darkest hours.\nFaith in God involves willingness to take risks. Ruth’s committment to follow the God of Naomi was made in the midst of immense uncertainty. Boaz took the risk of faithfulness and generosity, and he was richly rewarded.\nThe everyday and the ordinary can have breathtaking eternal impact. Ruth’s and Boaz’s daily faithfulness in the rhythms of farming, marriage, childbirth, and parenthood resulted in eternal blessings that have continued to multiply through King David and his descendant Jesus Christ.",

    "content": "The right leadership can give people a sense of safety when neighboring nations are hostile. In Samuel’s time, Israel faced external threats and internal discord, and the judges only provided a fleeting sense of security. Israel wanted a king. The book of 1 Samuel records Israel’s transition from a federation of tribes to a centralized kingdom. Saul, Israel’s first king, did not remain faithful to God. But then God chose David as king, and God’s plan to save Israel—and the world—began to unfold.\nSetting\nMoses had predicted that the people of Israel would ask for a king to reign over them (Deut 17:14-20). God spelled out the requirements for a king (Deut 17:15) but also warned of the evils commonly associated with human kings. A king would want many horses, numerous wives, and large sums of gold and silver (Deut 17:16-17). To mitigate these tendencies, God instructed that each king of Israel must study God’s law (Deut 17:18-20).\nThroughout the days of the judges, Israel’s tribes lacked unity (see Judg 17–21). By Samuel’s time, Israel was looking for a king to unite the nation and protect it from internal and external threats.\nGideon, who judged Israel about one hundred years before the time of Samuel, had acted a lot like a king. Gideon rejected the invitation to inaugurate a hereditary dynasty (Judg 8:22-23), but he began to act like a king: He accumulated gold and used it to build a religious idol (Judg 8:24-27), he took many wives (Judg 8:30), and he even named one of his sons Abimelech, which means “my father is king” (Judg 8:31). Gideon acted like the kind of king God wanted Israel never to have. A monarchy would give an imperfect human even more control than the judges exercised. 1 Samuel records the trouble that surrounded Israel’s first king, Saul, and begins to outline God’s unfolding plan to establish an eternal kingship through the line of David.\nSummary\nIn 1 Samuel 1–7, Samuel emerges as a judge and prophet of God. Samuel was born to a devout woman named Hannah, who had previously been barren (1:1-23). As a young child, Samuel, a Levite, (1 Chr 6:33-34) became an apprentice in the Tabernacle under the supervision of Eli the priest (1:24–3:18). Likely trained to be a Tabernacle assistant, Samuel instead became a prophet with a growing reputation (3:19–4:1a). Evidently, he was not yet prominent in Israel’s national life when the Philistines harassed the Israelites and captured the Ark of the Covenant (4:1–7:2), as he is absent from that narrative. In chapter 7, Samuel reappears, calling Israel to repentance; and acting as a judge, he drove out the Philistine oppressors.\nSamuel’s leadership as Levite, prophet, and judge spanned all spheres of public life. Yet his sons did not prove worthy of carrying on in his place (8:1-3), so Israel asked Samuel to appoint a king to lead them, just like the other nations. Samuel was outspoken in his opposition (8:10-21), yet the Lord instructed Samuel to anoint Saul as king (chs 9–10). In his farewell address, Samuel reminded the Israelites of God’s power and care for them (ch 12). He wanted them to realize their sin in asking for a king rather than trusting in the Lord.\nInitially, Saul was a good king. He defeated the neighboring Ammonites and saved the city of Jabesh-gilead from doom (ch 11). But Saul soon proved, by his disobedience to God, that he was unworthy to be Israel’s king (chs 13, 15). By contrast, Saul’s noble son Jonathan seemed to be an ideal successor (14:1-52). But Jonathan would not succeed Saul, because God had different plans (chs 16–31). God instructed Samuel to anoint David secretly as Saul’s successor while Saul was still king (16:1-13).\nSaul’s relationship with David was good at first, thanks in part to David’s musical gifts (16:14-23). However, David’s success with Goliath (17:1-58) made Saul jealous (18:6-16), and Saul tried to eliminate the threat David posed to his kingship. He brought David into his family by marriage to provide greater opportunities to kill him (18:17-29). He attacked David directly (19:1-10) and executed anybody who harbored David (chs 21–22). Yet all of Saul’s attempts to eliminate David proved unsuccessful.\nBoth Saul and Jonathan died in battle against the Philistines (31:1-6). This paved the way for David to begin his reign, though not without further difficulties (see 2 Sam 1:1–5:5).\nAuthorship\nThe title “Samuel” comes from the important role Samuel played in Israel’s transition to a monarchy, not from the book’s authorship. Samuel could have written parts of 1 Samuel, but he could not have written any part of 2 Samuel, as his death is recorded in 1 Samuel 25:1. The final editor of 1 Samuel is never identified.\nComposition\nThe books of 1–2 Samuel were originally one book. The translators of the Septuagint (the Greek Old Testament) divided it into two books, 1–2 Kingdoms. Later Hebrew tradition also divided the book but retained the name Samuel, as do most English versions.\nSome scholars contend that 1–2 Samuel (along with 1–2 Kings, also one book originally) were created from a variety of sources during or after the Babylonian Exile (586–538 BC). Multiple sources were doubtless used in 1–2 Samuel—for example, Samuel, Nathan, and Gad all chronicled events from the life of David (1 Chronicles 29:29). The inspired author of 1–2 Samuel would have made use of such information. However, the book also could have been near its final form during or shortly after the reign of Solomon (971–931 BC).\nShortly after Judah’s exile to Babylon, 1–2 Samuel was incorporated into the larger body of material that also includes Joshua, Judges, and 1–2 Kings. This section of Scripture traces Israel’s sacred history, beginning with blessing (conquering the land) and ending with judgment (losing the land). It explains to an audience in exile how their grave misfortune came about.\nManuscripts\nThe text of 1–2 Samuel that is found in the Greek Old Testament (the Septuagint, 200s BC) is different in many places from the Hebrew (Masoretic) text (around AD 1000). The Hebrew texts of Samuel in the Dead Sea Scrolls (around 250–50 BC) found at Qumran agree in some places with the Septuagint, in other places with the Masoretic Text. In still other places the Dead Sea texts have their own readings. Readers will encounter notes such as “Hebrew lacks . . . ” or “Greek reads . . . ” more frequently in 1–2 Samuel than in other Old Testament books. However, few of these textual variants significantly alter the meaning.\nMeaning and Message\nThe emphasis on kingship in 1 Samuel first appears in Hannah’s prayer (see 2:10). The idea that Israel would have a king was as old as God’s promise to Abraham and Sarah (Gen 17:6, 16). God neither mandated nor forbade a monarchy but only spelled out the excesses from which Israel’s kings must abstain (see Deut 17:14-20).\nDuring the period of the judges, Israel changed dramatically for the worse—both spiritually and nationally. This steady disintegration reaches a horrible climax in Judges 17–21. The book of Judges hints that, to help correct this decline, Israel needed a king. Israel’s greatest threat was not the Philistines or any other predatory neighbor but Israel itself and its breaking of the covenant. Israel needed a king to guard the covenant, which the pre-monarchical order had put at risk.\nIf the king’s responsibility was to administer the covenant (Deut 17:18-20), the prophet’s duty was to interpret its stipulations. For this reason, the prophet Samuel protected his divinely authorized claim over kings with a holy zeal. Not only did Samuel anoint Israel’s first two kings (1 Sam 10:1; 16:13), but he was also compelled to censure the king when he stepped outside of covenantal boundaries (13:8-15; 15:10-33).\nSaul did not have the character or integrity needed to lead Israel into a successful, God-honoring monarchy. Saul was not fated to fall, as though he had no control over his decisions. In fact, God wanted him to be a good king and made every provision for that to happen (such as changing his heart and giving him his Spirit). But God does not force righteousness, holiness, or obedience. His grace is persuasive but not coercive.\nDespite the deep disappointments of the era of the judges and the early monarchy, God’s sovereign control over Israel’s history is demonstrated in several ways: (1) A once-barren woman gave birth to Samuel, God’s agent for the transition to monarchy (ch 1); (2) a devastating Philistine victory became a Philistine defeat without human participation (chs 4–6); (3) the king whom the people demanded became God’s anointed (chs 8–10); (4) this king was rejected by God for his unfaithfulness (chs 13, 15); and (5) the eighth son of an obscure family, a man after God’s own heart, was chosen as the future king of Israel (ch 16).\nUnlike Saul’s rule, David’s kingship over Israel lasted, and one of his descendants later became the sovereign King of the whole world. Jesus is the final heir to David’s throne (John 7:42; Rev 5:5; 11:15). He perpetuates his ancestor’s virtues but never exhibits his flaws. Jesus is the world’s perfect and eternal Shepherd and King.",

    "content": "David’s ascension to power over all the tribes of Israel was lined with violence, politics, and intrigue. David was far from a perfect king—he committed adultery, then committed murder to cover it up, and chaos ensued in his family and the nation. Yet God was eternally committed to David and his descendants. He protected David during the many challenges to his authority and mercifully forgave and restored him when he sinned.\nSetting\nWhile Saul was still reigning, Samuel anointed David as Israel’s next king (1 Sam 16:1-13), but it was several years before David assumed the throne. Throughout most of this period, David was the object of Saul’s jealousy and wrath. Saul tried many times to kill David, but David never reciprocated when he had the chance. Instead, David trusted in the Lord’s plan and timing.\nDavid’s reign brought significant changes to Israel, both internally and externally. Internally, the nation began to develop a new awareness of itself as a unified nation. During Saul’s reign and the early part of David’s reign, the nation was not completely unified, and the twelve tribes still primarily found their identity at the tribal level rather than as a nation. By the end of David’s reign, a sense of national unity was in place that set the stage for the glory days of King Solomon.\nExternally, Israel’s position in relation to its neighbors improved significantly during David’s reign. Most notably, the constant threat posed by the Philistines, so obvious in the book of Judges and throughout Saul’s reign, largely vanished as the result of David’s skillful leadership (see, e.g., 2 Sam 5:17-25; 21:15-22; 23:9-17). David’s reign brought peace and stability to Israel’s borders.\nSummary\nFor 7½ years after the deaths of Saul and Jonathan (1:1-27), David reigned as king of Judah only. For two years of that time, Saul’s only surviving son, Ishbosheth, was king of the northern tribes, and this led to a murderous civil war. David became progressively stronger while Ishbosheth became weaker. In the end, Ishbosheth and his top commander, Abner, were assassinated against David’s wishes (3:22–4:12). Following Ishbosheth’s death, the leaders of the northern tribes pledged their loyalty to David. David immediately relocated his capital from Hebron to the more centrally located Jerusalem, driving out its Jebusite inhabitants (5:6-16).\nJerusalem was more than David’s political capital. By bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, David made it Israel’s spiritual capital as well (6:1-15). Shortly thereafter, God made an eternal covenant with David and his descendants (7:1-29). In these early years, David enjoyed success on every side (8:1-18; 10:1-19) and fulfilled his vow to treat the descendants of Saul and Jonathan kindly (9:1-13).\nThen David made the worst mistake of his life: He brought Bathsheba, who was another man’s wife, to his house for sexual intimacy (11:1-5). She became pregnant, and David arranged for her husband’s murder (11:6-27). God was angry with David’s actions and chastised him (12:1-12). Although David repented and experienced God’s forgiveness, the child conceived in the affair died (12:13-23). Yet David remained God’s chosen king (12:24-31).\nFrom this point forward, problems compounded for David. Amnon, one of David’s sons, raped his half sister Tamar, and her brother Absalom avenged the act (13:1-39). Later, Absalom tried to overthrow and replace David, but he was killed in the coup (14:1–19:43). Sheba, a Benjamite, also led a revolt against David but was defeated and executed (20:1-26).\nAs king, David twice acted to allay God’s wrath against the nation (21:1-22; 24:1-25). In the second instance, David built an altar in Jerusalem (24:18-25) on what became the site of the Temple (see 1 Chr 21:18–22:1). Sandwiched between these two episodes are passages that celebrate God’s power working through David and descriptions of the loyalty and heroism of David’s special warriors (22:1–23:39).\nAuthorship\nThe same anonymous author who wrote 1 Samuel probably also wrote 2 Samuel (see 1 Samuel Book Introduction, “Authorship”).\nHistorical Issues\nEvidence for David. For a long time, David’s name had not been discovered in any document from antiquity outside of the Bible. This led some critical scholars to claim that David and his story were fictitious. However, in 1993, archaeologists working at Tell Dan in northern Israel found an inscription in Aramaic about Hazael, king of Syria (around 842–800 BC), who was celebrating a military victory over Israel and Judah. The inscription reads, “I put Jeho . . . , son of . . . ruler of  Israel, and . . .iahu, son of . . .g of the house of David to death” (ellipses represent portions of the text illegible in the inscription). This inscription provides evidence of David’s existence and acknowledgment that he founded a dynasty in Judah.\nViolence. To a greater degree than any other biblical book, 2 Samuel tells of murders and executions, most notably those involving David’s political rivals and their supporters (Saul and Jonathan, 1:1-15; Abner, 3:30; Ishbosheth, 4:6-8; Absalom, 18:14-15; other male descendants of Saul, 21:8-9; Amasa, 20:10; Sheba, 20:21-22). However, the narrator is careful to show that David was not responsible for these murders. Contrary to the claims of some (see 16:5-8), David could not be accused of murderous political ambition. David was guilty of murder only in the case of Uriah. Without question, this was a horrible sin, but it was devoid of political motive.\nDavid had no involvement in the many murders surrounding his rise to power. He was not a usurper who violently eliminated the previous royal family. In fact, he genuinely lamented the deaths of Saul and Jonathan and ordered the executions of those who killed Saul and Ishbosheth (1:1-16; 4:12). David had deep respect for Saul as the Lord’s anointed king. Although David was aware that God had anointed him to replace Saul, he refused to take the matter into his own hands.\nMeaning and Message\nThe book of 2 Samuel reports how God brought the private anointing of David as king (1 Sam 16:1-13) to public fruition. Moreover, God made a covenant with David to solidify his commitment to David’s dynasty.\nGod’s covenant with David bears significant similarities to the covenant with Abraham. Both include promises of great fame (Gen 12:2; 2 Sam 7:9) and of rest from their enemies (Gen 15:18-21; 2 Sam 7:10). Both are binding forever (Gen 13:15; 2 Sam 7:16), and much of the land God promised to Abraham and his descendants (Gen 15:18) was acquired through David’s expansion of his empire (2 Sam 5:17-25; 8:1-14; 10:1-9).\nGod’s commitment to David was crucial to David’s successes—despite civil war, revolts, the murderous ambition of some loyal subjects, and his personal failures. His shortcomings—particularly his adultery with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah—could lead one to wonder whether David would become like Saul, rejected by God and replaced by another. God certainly did punish David when he sinned (12:1–20:26; 24:1-25). Yet God remained committed to David and to his dynasty (7:14-16). God’s commitment, rather than David’s merit, explains his success.\nKingship was central in God’s plan for his people and his creation. God’s commitment to David points beyond David and his immediate descendants to a distant son, Jesus Christ. The New Testament both begins (Matt 1:1) and ends (Rev 22:16) by focusing on Jesus, the Eternal King, as the descendant of David.",

    "content": "Solomon’s kingdom was the pinnacle of Israel’s glory. “King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth” (1 Kgs 10:23). The Queen of Sheba confirmed the glory of Solomon’s kingdom, saying, “Everything I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom is true! I didn’t believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes” (10:6-7). First Kings celebrates the splendor of Solomon’s kingdom. But Solomon’s reign also illustrates the dangers of spiritual infidelity, and 1 Kings warns about the results of preoccupation with luxury, fame, self, and security. It is a timeless warning to us all.\nSetting\nAt the height of his power, Solomon administered a kingdom that stretched “from the Euphrates River in the north to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt in the south” (4:21). Solomon’s power and wealth brought him in contact with many surrounding nations—especially the important maritime city-state of Tyre and the age-old empire of Egypt.\nThe mid-900s BC was an ideal time for Solomon’s kingdom to expand, for the traditional political powers of the area were in decline. The strong Hittite kingdom to the north had broken up into a number of small states. In Mesopotamia, years of struggle with the Arameans and the Hittites had weakened Assyria, which remained weak until the accession of Ashur-dan II (934–912 BC). In the south, Egypt’s presence in Canaan had weakened during the 21st dynasty (1069–945 BC). Egypt would not make an effective military comeback until the rule of the 22nd dynasty pharaoh Shoshenq I (Shishak, 945–924 BC).\nUnfortunately, Solomon’s foreign diplomacy involved marriages with the daughters of foreign kings. This was a common way to cement alliances in the ancient Near East, but it was spiritually disastrous, for “in Solomon’s old age, they turned his heart to worship other gods instead of being completely faithful to the Lord his God” (11:4).\nTensions that had been smoldering between the northern and southern Hebrew tribes surfaced with Solomon’s death in 931 BC. The resulting schism restructured the kingdom into Israel (the northern ten tribes) and Judah (the remaining two southern tribes). Israel and Judah skirmished repeatedly during the era of the first two northern dynasties and the reigns of Judah’s first three kings (931~874 BC). The hostility subsided when King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah found a common cause against the Arameans (chs 20, 22).\nThe Hebrew kingdoms of Israel and Judah were increasingly entangled by the expansionist ambitions of their neighbors. They were invaded by Shoshenq I of Egypt in 926 BC, and throughout the 800s BC they faced the constant menace of the Arameans and the rising power of Assyria. During the reigns of the Assyrian kings Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC) and Shalmaneser III (858–824 BC), Assyrian troops moved steadily westward to the Mediterranean Sea. At the famous Battle of Qarqar (853 BC), a coalition of western allies, including Israel’s King Ahab, withstood the Assyrian king Shalmaneser and temporarily sidetracked Assyria’s advance.\nDuring this time, the two Hebrew kingdoms struggled spiritually. Israel stopped worshiping the Lord at Solomon’s Temple, and Jeroboam I, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel (931–910 BC), instituted apostate religious practices that led the northern kingdom astray (see 2 Kgs 17:21-23). Judah’s first two kings, Rehoboam and Abijah, lapsed spiritually, while the subsequent two kings, Asa and Jehoshaphat, maintained greater, though not perfect, spiritual fidelity (1 Kgs 15:11; 22:43).\nSummary\nBeginning with King David’s last days, 1 Kings describes the establishment of Solomon’s glorious empire (971–931 BC) and the events that subsequently divided the kingdom in two (the kingdom of Israel in the north and the kingdom of Judah in the south). The book then traces the varying fortunes of the two kingdoms to about 853 BC, into the reign of Ahaziah in Israel (853–852 BC).\nThe first eleven chapters center on King Solomon, recounting both his fabulous reign and his later spiritual compromise. Solomon’s story begins and ends in controversy. Solomon was David’s chosen successor, but his older brother Adonijah attempted to seize the throne (1:1–2:46). Solomon triumphed over Adonijah’s rival claim, then used his God-given wisdom to reorganize the government and make it more efficient. He facilitated the kingdom’s commercial expansion on land and sea and undertook extensive building projects, including the marvelous Temple and the palace complex. Toward the end of his reign, however, Solomon’s spiritual decline (11:1-13) and oppressive administrative measures (e.g., 5:13-18) incited political adversaries both inside and outside the country (11:14-40).\nGod appeared three times to Solomon, giving us a glimpse of his personal spiritual journey. The first time, early in Solomon’s reign, God granted his request for wisdom to rule the kingdom (3:5-15), which resulted in great prosperity and honor (3:16–8:66). After Solomon finished building the Temple and palace, God visited him a second time to remind him that his continued success would depend on spiritual fidelity (9:1-9). However, Solomon’s great fame (9:10–10:29) led him into foreign alliances, cemented by customary marriages with the daughters of foreign kings. Solomon’s resulting spiritual compromise eventually led him so far as to sponsor the worship of pagan deities (11:1-8). God visited Solomon a third and final time; this time he rebuked Solomon for his failure to honor the covenant. Solomon’s unfaithfulness would ultimately cause the kingdom’s division after his death (11:9-13).\nThe second section of the book (12:1–16:26) demonstrates that God’s judgment came quickly after Solomon’s death. At the beginning of the reign of King Rehoboam, the northern tribes requested relief from forced labor and heavy taxation. Rehoboam rebuffed their request and antagonized them, so the northern tribes rebelled and established the kingdom of Israel in the north, with Jeroboam I as king. Rehoboam remained on the throne of Judah, now a separate kingdom, in the south (12:1-24). During the following era, Israel’s first two dynasties (Jeroboam I to Tibni) spiritually degraded the northern kingdom, while the kings of Judah degraded the southern kingdom. Political instability marked the northern kingdom, with royal assassinations, contests for power, and the establishment of Israel’s notorious third dynasty, founded by King Omri, who was one of the most powerful and evil kings of Israel (16:25-26).\nThe final section of 1 Kings is primarily devoted to the reign of Omri’s son Ahab (16:29–22:40). Israel had begun worshiping the Canaanite storm-god Baal, so the Lord commissioned Elijah to confront Ahab and to demonstrate the Lord’s power, showing that he alone is God (17:1–18:46). Elijah then fled from the wrath of Queen Jezebel, but God reclaimed and recommissioned him, with Elisha as his successor (19:1-21).\nOn the political front, King Ahab faced repeated challenges from the Aramean king Ben-hadad, against whom Ahab fought three campaigns (20:1-25, 26-43; 22:1-40), the last of which cost Ahab his life. Between the second and third campaigns, Ahab, aided by his ruthless wife Jezebel, murdered an innocent man named Naboth and confiscated his property (21:1-29).\nGod’s prophets figured prominently in the events of Ahab’s reign. In Ahab’s first two campaigns against the Arameans, an unnamed prophet first counseled the king (20:22) and then rebuked him (20:35-43). The prophet Elijah later censured Ahab’s seizure of Naboth’s vineyard (21:1-29). Then, before Ahab’s third battle against the Arameans, the prophet Micaiah warned of Ahab’s impending death (22:5-28).\nThe book of 1 Kings closes with a brief word concerning the character and reign of Judah’s King Jehoshaphat (22:41-50) and introduces Ahab’s successor, Ahaziah (22:51-53), whose story begins 2 Kings.\nAuthorship and Composition\nThe books of 1–2 Kings reflect the coherent perspective of a single unknown author, whom Jewish tradition identifies as Jeremiah (Baba Batra 15a). The author witnessed firsthand the fall of Jerusalem and was well acquainted with sources that enabled him to compose a rich history of Solomon’s reign and the divided monarchy. Available to the author were official archives of the palace and Temple and records kept in various prophetic centers. He skillfully weaved these sources into a unified presentation, displaying a central concern regarding his people’s repeated failure to honor their covenant relationship with God.\nIt is uncertain whether the author was still alive and wrote the final appendix concerning Jehoiachin’s release (561 BC; 2 Kgs 25:27-30; cp. Jer 52:31-34). If not, these verses were appended by someone well acquainted with 1–2 Kings and of a kindred spirit with the primary author.\nThe books of 1–2 Kings cover essentially the same time period as 2 Chronicles. Accordingly, there are numerous parallel passages with similar wording. But the authors had different purposes in writing, and these differences can be highlighted by comparing the various parallel passages.\nDate\nBecause 2 Kings records the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC (2 Kgs 24:18–25:21), the composition of 1–2 Kings must have been completed afterward.\nThe dating of the reigns of various kings and the chronological arrangement of 1–2 Kings remain somewhat problematic, but the general dating of the period seems clear. The basic period for 1 Kings stretches from around 973 BC (including approximately the last two years of David’s reign in Jerusalem, 2 Sam 5:4-5) to around 853 BC, during the reigns of Jehoshaphat of Judah (872–848 BC) and Ahaziah of Israel (853–852 BC). Second Kings picks up where 1 Kings left off (originally, 1–2 Kings was one book). The final appendix to 2 Kings (2 Kgs 25:27-30) was written shortly after the death of Nebuchadnezzar II in 562 BC.\nChronology\nThe dates for the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah are determined by comparing biblical data with information from other sources from the period, including historical annals and records of astronomical phenomena. The data frequently highlights the practice of co-regency, whereby a reigning king designated his son as both heir apparent and co-ruler. This practice was common in both Israel and Judah. Hence, the dating of the various kings is not necessarily sequential, but contains a certain extent of overlap. While ascertaining precise dates across the monarchical period is complex, the remarkable harmony between the records of Assyria, Babylon, Aram, Egypt, and Israel highlights the historical reliability of the biblical records.\nMeaning and Message\nThe primary concern of 1 Kings is Israel’s spiritual condition: How well did Israel’s rulers and people keep God’s covenants? God’s special covenant with David had conditions for blessing Israel’s king and his kingdom (2 Sam 7:12-16; Ps 89:20-37). God’s three appearances to Solomon highlight the potential for a successful and meaningful spiritual life, as well as the tragic consequences of spiritual infidelity and relying upon expediency. Each succeeding king is evaluated by his faithfulness to God—by his success or failure in keeping God’s covenants.\nThe book of 1 Kings emphasizes the role of God’s prophets in advising, admonishing, and warning the kings. While particular attention is devoted to Elijah’s ministry (1 Kgs 17:1–19:21; 21:1-29), God also works through other prophets to claim his people’s loyalty.\nThe spiritual odysseys of Israel’s kings and prophets challenge all of God’s people to faithful devotion and service. Israel’s frequent preference for what is tangible and expedient reminds us to “keep away from anything that might take God’s place in [our] hearts”(1 Jn 5:21). Like the prophets of old, God’s servants today are to proclaim the necessity of worshiping God alone.",

    "content": "The book of 2 Kings is filled with leaders who did not learn from the past. By virtue of their spiritual failure, these kings brought doom upon themselves and their nation. However, there are also sparkling examples of people who put God and his word first and enjoyed the blessings God promised. Reading the accounts of the kings’ lives inspires us to avoid their mistakes and to enjoy the blessings that God promises to those who love and serve him.\nSetting\nThe book of 2 Kings continues the story of Israel’s divided monarchy, picking up where 1 Kings ends, with Ahaziah reigning over the northern kingdom of Israel and Jehoshaphat ruling in the southern kingdom of Judah. The account traces the fortunes of the two kingdoms to their respective ends—the northern kingdom in 722 BC, the southern kingdom in 586 BC.\nSummary\nThe book of 2 Kings is structured around the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. Four different periods are covered: (1) the closing years of the northern kingdom’s third dynasty (853–841 BC, 1:1–9:37), (2) the era of the northern kingdom’s fourth dynasty (841–752 BC, 10:1–15:12), (3) the period of the northern kingdom’s decline and fall (752–722 BC, 15:13–17:41), and (4) the final era of the southern kingdom (722–586 BC, 18:1–25:30).\nThe book begins with an accident that caused the death of King Ahaziah of Israel (1:1-18) and with the closing event of Elijah’s life, when God took him into heaven (2:1-12). The prophetic mantle passed to Elisha, whose miracles and advice occupy the next several chapters (2:12–8:15; see 9:1-10).\nThe reigns of kings Jehoram and Ahaziah of Judah (8:16-29) bring the account to the pivotal year of 841 BC, when Jehu killed kings Joram and Ahaziah. Jehu also executed Jezebel, the surviving members of Ahab’s family, and the officials who worshiped Baal (9:11–10:29). So Jehu’s twenty-eight-year reign began (10:30-36). At the same time Athaliah (11:1-20) usurped the throne of Judah and reigned for six years until those loyal to David’s line installed young Joash as king (12:1-21).\nThe twin kingdoms enjoyed prosperity for a time (14:23–15:7), but the northern kingdom continued to do evil and entered its decline: Zechariah’s assassination (15:8-12) was followed by the short reigns of Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah, Pekah, and Hoshea (15:13–17:2). Hoshea, Israel’s last king (732–722 BC), foolishly placed his confidence in Egypt and rebelled against Assyria, bringing about the capture of Samaria and the end of the northern kingdom in 722 BC (17:3-6). The author then evaluates the reasons for Israel’s fall and gives an account of Samaria’s repopulation (17:7-41).\nThe final section of 2 Kings (18:1–25:30) deals with the fortunes of Judah. Hezekiah is remembered for trusting the Lord while under pressure (18:5-6; see 18:13–20:11), and Josiah earns praise for his devotion to the law of the Lord (23:19; see 22:8–23:25). However, even these two kings made critical mistakes (20:12-19; 23:29-30; see 2 Chr 35:20-25).\nFollowing Josiah’s death, the final kings of Judah did what was evil in the Lord’s sight, and the southern kingdom was ravaged and finally destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (2 Kgs 23:31–25:21). God’s prophesied judgment had come (see Jer 38:17-23), and the glorious kingdom of Israel passed into the realm of memory.\nThe book of 2 Kings closes with two appended notes. The first deals with events in Judah after the fall of Jerusalem (2 Kgs 25:22-26). The second describes the later release of Jehoiachin in Babylon (25:27-30).\nAuthorship and Date\nThe book of 2 Kings is a continuation of 1 Kings, written by the same author, whose precise identity is unknown. He was well acquainted with sources that enabled him to compose a detailed history of Israel’s divided monarchy, and he had insight to evaluate the reasons for successes and failures on the basis of the people’s response to the Mosaic covenant. His intimate acquaintance with Judah’s later history indicates that he may have lived in or near Jerusalem and may have been an eyewitness to many of the events that brought about the city’s fall. Whether he was still alive to write the final appendix about Jehoiachin’s release (561 BC, 25:25-30) is uncertain. If not, these verses were added by someone well acquainted with 2 Kings and of a kindred spirit with the primary writer. One tradition holds that the single author of 1–2 Kings was Jeremiah and that he was taken to Babylon during Nebuchadnezzar’s return from a campaign in Egypt (around 568 BC) and lived there well into his nineties.\nBased on information in the closing chapters, the final composition of 2 Kings most likely took place shortly after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, with the final appendix to the book added shortly after Nebuchadnezzar II’s death in 562 BC.\nChronology\nSecond Kings is filled with chronological information about the kings of Israel and Judah, but none of this information gives us absolute dates. We obtain absolute dates by comparing Israel’s records with the records of surrounding nations (Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt) and with astronomical calculations. Remarkable harmony is found among the records, which serves as evidence that Israel’s accounts are historically accurate and precise.\nMeaning and Message\nEach king of the divided monarchy is evaluated on the basis of his faithfulness (or lack thereof) to God. They either “did what was pleasing in the Lord’s sight” or “did what was evil in the Lord’s sight.”\nThe kings of Israel were consistently evil. They “followed the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat, continuing the sins that Jeroboam had led Israel to commit” (13:2, 11; 14:24; 15:9; 17:2). Many of the kings of Judah receive similar censure (see e.g., 8:18). Manasseh, in particular, is condemned for his rampant idolatry and apostasy (21:2-9), and his example is followed by several kings after him (21:20; 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19).\nSeveral kings of Judah are commended, however, for doing “what was pleasing in the Lord’s sight” (12:2; 14:3; 15:3, 34; 18:3; 22:2). Such men were concerned for the upkeep and repair of the Temple (12:6-16; 22:3-7) and for obedience to the precepts of God’s word (18:6; 22:8-13; 23:1-3). Hezekiah and Josiah receive special commendation: Hezekiah for his trust in the Lord and his honoring of God’s word (18:5-6), and Josiah for his high regard for the law of Moses (23:25). The implication is clear. God’s people are to live in accord with the high standards of God’s word so that they may do what is “pleasing in God’s sight” (cp. Ps 119:9-11, 111; 2 Tim 3:16-17).\nThe prominence given to the final days of the great prophet Elijah (1:3-17; 2:1-11) and to Elisha’s spectacular ministry (2:12-25; 3:11-19; 4:1–7:2; 8:1-2) emphasizes the need to proclaim God’s words to others (Acts 20:18-21; 2 Tim 2:15; 4:2) so that they may come into covenant relationship with the Lord (2 Cor 3:4-6).\nFinally, the failures of even the good kings remind God’s people to steadfastly be faithful to the Lord and serve him. Then their lives can be filled with good (Ps 84:11; Rom 14:7-8), and when they stand before God for judgment (Rom 14:10-11; 2 Cor 5:10), he will reward and praise them (2 Tim 4:7-8; Rev 2:10; see Matt 25:23).",

    "content": "The books of 1–2 Chronicles were written to inspire hope. Exile had robbed the people of Israel of their wealth, and their return to the land created resentment among their neighbors. Despondency and apathy threatened to destroy them entirely. The Chronicler’s task was to establish and validate the people’s links with the past. In writing this history, he organized the past in a way that provided meaning and value for the present. He believed that his community, Judea, was critically significant in representing the Kingdom of God. He knew that the community needed to retain its distinctive sense of identity in order to fulfill its purpose.\nSetting\nThe Babylonians had conquered the kingdom of Judah between 605 and 586 BC. Within a generation, Babylonian power eroded because of its own internal decay (see Dan 5). Meanwhile, to the east, the Persian king Cyrus the Great (559–530 BC) established a new empire that united the Medes and the Persians. In October 539 BC, Babylon fell without resistance, and Cyrus’s empire extended westward to include Babylonia (see Dan 5:30-31).\nIn keeping with his imperial policy, Cyrus provided for the Jewish exiles to return to Judea and establish a province around the city of Jerusalem. The account of this period is told in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. The community experienced spiritual restoration, physical protection, and a measure of economic independence. Yet there was virtually no hope of political autonomy. The besieged community bore little resemblance to the former kingdom. They also faced scorn, opposition, and humiliation from surrounding peoples as they rebuilt the Temple and later the wall of Jerusalem. They struggled to maintain their identity, faith, and way of life as social and political forces threatened to absorb them completely. They needed a sense of purpose and hope.\nThe people of Judea faced some profound questions at this time: How could they remain true to their ancestral faith while living under the domination of an imperial power? How could a subordinate people be the people of God? What did the promise of the eternal throne of David mean under these circumstances? Some Jews in later Greek and Roman times (e.g., the Maccabees and the “zealots” of the New Testament era) answered these questions with a nationalism that sought to rebel and establish independence. Other Jews, perceiving their situation as inescapable, focused on covenant faithfulness to God within the context of empire. The book of 1 Chronicles was written to address these questions and concerns.\nSummary\nThe text of 1 Chronicles divides into two distinct sections: the portrayal of Israel’s identity through genealogies (1 Chr 1:1–9:44), and David’s preparing of Jerusalem for the Temple and the rule of Solomon (10:1–29:30).\nThe first chapter of genealogies (ch 1) moves along the line of God’s selection of specific people from Adam to Jacob (= Israel). Chapters 2–8 deal with the Israelites from Jacob until the exile to Babylon. This section first details the tribe of Judah (chs 2–4), discussing the house of David in the central section (ch 3), and then describes the other tribes of Israel (chs 5–7), including those east of the Jordan River (in Transjordan). At the midpoint in these additional genealogical lists comes Levi (ch 6), a tribe with central significance. The record then continues with the tribe of Benjamin (ch 8). The genealogies are completed down to about 400 BC, with a list of the chief representatives of the community who returned from exile and began restoring Jerusalem (ch 9).\nSaul’s genealogy (9:35-44) introduces the founding of the monarchy. When Saul died because of his unfaithfulness (10:1-14), David became king (11:1–12:40). The chapters on David’s reign explain his organization of officials and his preparations for the Temple (chs 13–27). The transfer of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (chs 13–16) served as a major event in the establishment of David’s kingdom. The remainder of 1 Chronicles traces the steps taken toward building the Temple. These chapters include the identity of the builder (ch 17), the necessary political conditions (chs 18–20), the site (ch 21), the personnel (chs 23–27), the materials, and the plans (chs 22, 28–29). The account of David’s reign closes with a great public assembly and Solomon’s commissioning as the king of peace who would build the Temple (chs 28–29).\nAuthorship and Date\nThe books of Chronicles are traditionally ascribed to Ezra, but the author left no indications about his own identity apart from the content of his writings. The Chronicler lived in or near Jerusalem and was an ardent supporter of the Temple and its services. The prominence he gives to the Levites in his writing might suggest that he was among their number. (This would explain his access to the material he used to compose his history.)\nThe Chronicler wrote in the latter years of the Persian Empire, probably around 400 BC. The genealogy of the descendants of Jehoiachin (3:17-24) suggests a date that is eight generations later than Zerubbabel, who served as governor around 520 BC, during the days of Darius, king of Persia (Zech 1:1; 4:9). The Chronicler probably wrote some time after Nehemiah traveled to Jerusalem in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes (445 BC) to repair the walls of the city (Neh 2:1). Chronicles was not written as late as the Greek period, beginning with Alexander the Great (332 BC), because the writing contains no linguistic or ideological evidence of Greek influence. These considerations point to a date around 400 BC.\nHistorical Situation\nLittle is known about the situation in Judea after Nehemiah, although Nehemiah reveals some of the difficulties of the community. The temptation to marry outside of Israel was great, and mixed marriages remained in the days of Malachi (400s BC; see Mal 2:14-16). Foreign marriages gave access to land and wealth that were not available within the community. This practice was contrary to the law, however, which Ezra brought back with him from Babylon. The self-sufficiency and exclusivity enjoined by Ezra and Nehemiah aroused the ongoing resentment and hostility of the surrounding peoples, particularly as the Jews sought to reestablish the Temple as the social and economic center of the community.\nGenre and Composition\nThe title of Chronicles also defines the genre of the work. In Hebrew, the term refers to “the events of the days.” In the prologue to the Latin translation of Samuel and Kings, Jerome calls Chronicles the chronikon, or “annals,” a register of events, a record book of ancient times. In other words, it is written as a history. Meanwhile, the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint), calls this history “the left-over things.” This title regarded Chronicles as a secondary complement to Kings, an attitude that likely would have horrified its author. This work is a unique creation from many different sources.\nIn writing this history, the Chronicler organized Israel’s past in a way that provided meaning and value for its intended readers. He included genealogies because they answered two critical questions of history: Whose story needed to be told? and Where did these people live? The Chronicler’s work explains why a people with no influence or recognition considered their existence and way of life to be of profound significance for the future.\nThe book of 1 Chronicles covers essentially the same time period as 2 Samuel. Accordingly, there are numerous parallel passages with similar wording. But the authors had different purposes in writing, and these differences can be highlighted by comparing the various parallel passages.\nMeaning and Message\nGod’s promise to David (17:1-27) occupies the center of the Chronicler’s message. When David determined to build a house for God’s Ark of the Covenant, Nathan the prophet had a vision informing him that David had it backwards: David would not build a house for God, but God would build a house for David. This house would be a dynasty (2 Sam 7:11-14 // 1 Chr 17:10-14), and the eternal Kingdom of God would come about through David’s lineage. Psalm 2 expresses the importance of this promise: God held the nations in derision because they rejected his kingdom and thought that they could establish their own rule. They ignored the fact that God had already anointed his king on Mount Zion, a king who would shatter the nations and receive the earth as his inheritance. The Chronicler took this promise very seriously. The Kingdom of God would come through the promised son of David. The community around Jerusalem represented that promised Kingdom, the hope of the future.\nThe Chronicler had a double task. First, he needed to explain why the kingdom of David had failed. Second, he needed to establish that this small, struggling province of the mighty Persian Empire would become the kingdom that God had promised to David. The explanation for the failure of David’s kingdom begins with Saul’s failure: God rejected Saul as king over Israel because he was unfaithful. Saul did not obey God, and he violated the covenant to the extent of consulting a medium (10:13). Later kings repeated the essence of Saul’s failure: They rebelled against God’s covenant, and they sought security from foreign powers and pagan gods rather than from their Rock, the Lord (see Deut 32:4, 15-39). Thus unfaithfulness is a key word in Chronicles; the Chronicler uses it repeatedly to document the reasons for judgment against the kings of Judah.\nThe rationale for hope, on the other hand, comes from Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple: “Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land” (2 Chr 7:14). This promise reminds the people of the conditions necessary for restoration: humility, prayer, repentance, and healing.\nThe book of 1 Chronicles establishes the necessary premises for restoration. The promise to David did not disappear during the Exile; the community that was reestablished in Jerusalem carried the promise. Even the division of the kingdom after Solomon’s reign had not put any of the tribes outside of Israel’s future. For the Chronicler, all the tribes were present in the restoration, including those of the northern kingdom (see 1 Chr 9:3). The Chronicler understood Israel as a people of faith, not as a political entity. Israel was not a sovereign nation in his day but was a small ethnic province in the mighty empire of Persia. Yet he wanted to show that the unity established by David and Solomon had endured and that the promise made to David gave them hope for the future.",

    "content": "Second Chronicles gives purpose and hope to a people with an uncertain future. God had promised that David’s descendants would have an everlasting kingdom, but the people of Judah had been exiled to Babylon. Even after returning to Jerusalem, they now lived as Persian subjects. Judah had no king descended from David and no hope of becoming a kingdom. Yet God’s promises are certain, so the Chronicler encouraged the Judeans to hope for the future. The words of King Jehoshaphat capture the spirit of the book: “Listen to me, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be able to stand firm. Believe in his prophets, and you will succeed” (2 Chr 20:20).\nSetting\nThe Babylonian conquest of Judah occurred in 605–586 BC, about two centuries before Chronicles was written (around 400 BC; see 1 Chronicles Book Introduction, “Authorship and Date”).\n To address questions about God’s purposes and promises, the Chronicler narrated the past of the Israelites from the earliest times until the destruction of the kingdom of Judah. By carefully selecting his material and reworking it to suit his own purposes, he did not intend to replace or supplement earlier historical writings. Instead, he presumed that his readers were already familiar with his main sources and knew the characters in his books. He made his writings vital to his own time: He evaluated the past from his own vantage point and wrote so that his contemporaries could understand their heritage, the Temple and its worship, and the status of God’s promises.\nSummary\nThe first nine chapters of 2 Chronicles focus on the reign of Solomon. Much of this narrative pertains to the building of the Temple and to providing for the priests. Solomon’s prayer and God’s response are central to the Chronicler’s account of Solomon (6:1–7:22). God responded to Solomon’s prayer in a vision that articulated the Chronicler’s own theological perspective (7:12-22): God answers the prayers and repentance of his people; he brings judgment upon the disobedient, but he rewards humility and prayer with healing and deliverance.\nAfter recording the division of the monarchy, the Chronicler focused almost exclusively on the southern kingdom of Judah. He associated the continuity of the kingdom and Israel’s future with the dynasty of David and the Temple in Jerusalem. However, David’s descendants who ruled Judah were not always models of obedience. Meanwhile, the northern kingdom, Israel, sometimes did what was right (e.g., 28:5-15). The Chronicler saw the northern kingdom as a part of Israel that needed to be restored, and he took special interest in contacts between the north and the south. He did not condemn the northerners for the division, but he did blame them for their refusal to return once their grievances were settled, as he considered their future to be closely tied to Judah.\nThe Chronicler’s portrayal of Judah’s kings sometimes departs remarkably from parallel descriptions in the book of Kings. Uzziah appears as a minor figure in Kings (2 Kgs 15:1-7), even though he was a powerful king who ruled for more than fifty years. In Chronicles, Uzziah is a famous reformer and builder. Likewise, although little is said about Jotham in Kings (2 Kgs 15:32-38), in Chronicles his work is portrayed as extensive (2 Chr 27:3-4). The Chronicler also expands our understanding of Hezekiah (29:1–32:33), dealing extensively with Hezekiah’s reforms and the restoration of Temple worship, and describing at length how Hezekiah prepared for the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem.\nThe reigns of Manasseh and Amon follow (33:1-25); their wickedness and idolatry set the stage for Judah’s demise. In Chronicles, unlike Kings, we learn how Manasseh experienced his own exile, repentance, and return to Judah—a microcosm of what the Judeans themselves later experienced.\nJosiah’s reign (34:1–35:27) was pleasing to God. But when Josiah died (609 BC), Judah’s end soon followed. Within four years, the Babylonians began a series of attacks (605–586 BC) that led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple and the exile of most of the population to Babylon (36:2-21). The covenant unfaithfulness of the people of Judah had come to fruition.\nThe account ends with a glimmer of hope: Cyrus’s proclamation in 538 BC that allowed the Jews to return to Judah and rebuild Jerusalem (36:22-23).\nChronicles as History\nChronicles is an ancient work of history with a distinctive approach. The book of 2 Chronicles covers essentially the same time period as 1–2 Kings. And while the Chronicler drew upon the earlier records of Samuel, Kings, and other sources, his own work shows remarkable independence. He gave detailed attention to military, administrative, and geopolitical affairs in times that were already hundreds of years distant. He frequently added detailed information not found in any other surviving sources but evidently available to him.\nArchaeology occasionally provides confirmation of administrative and geopolitical reforms discussed by the Chronicler. For example, an inscription has been found in the Siloam Tunnel describing Hezekiah’s water project. Most of the time, the evidence has only a broad connection, such as with Uzziah’s building activity or agricultural initiatives. The work of the Chronicler is a valuable resource for understanding the history of the times he wrote about.\nMeaning and Message\nA fundamental question for the restored community in Judea after the Exile was: What is our relationship to the Israel of the past? They were no longer an independent nation but a small province of the Persian Empire. Judea had no king, lived under foreign domination, and had only recently rebuilt the Temple destroyed by the Babylonians. What validity did God’s promises regarding the Temple and David’s dynasty have for the community?\nTo the Chronicler, David’s reign offered a paradigm for his own readers. David moved from being a fugitive from Saul (a condition of exile) to being in the community of God. The postexilic community reading Chronicles had undergone a similar transition from exile and could anticipate similar blessings if they were obedient.\nChronicles presents the period of David and Solomon as an ideal time when all of Israel united in worship (7:8). The account of David’s reign displays much concern for the correct worship of God. The restoration of the Ark to Jerusalem and David’s military victories provided for the future Temple, and David made all the necessary arrangements regarding the officials who would serve as worship shifted to Jerusalem.\nThe Chronicler regards Solomon’s reign as equal to David’s, because Solomon brought to fruition David’s plans for the Temple and for worship there (3:1; 5:1; 7:1). In Chronicles, David appoints Solomon to the throne in a public announcement, and Solomon enjoys divine blessing and the total support of the people. The Chronicler does not mention Adonijah’s attempted coup or Solomon’s sins, and he shifts blame for the schism to Jeroboam (13:6-7). Solomon’s wealth and international influence reflect his glorious, peaceful, and righteous reign.\nThe division of Israel into northern and southern kingdoms shows the failure of the kingdom to meet its ideals, but it does not mean that all hope was lost. Obedience still results in God’s blessing, and disobedience will be punished. Each time a calamity is recounted, the Chronicler provides a cause for judgment, and he emphasizes the blessings that result from faithfulness. Repentance is always a means of averting or at least moderating judgment. Prophetic warnings are always issued before judgment comes, and the possibility of healing is always present. This pattern provides a primary way that the Chronicler communicates hope for the future in his own time.\nThe Chronicler also offers events in the reign of Hezekiah as a solution to the problem of the divided monarchy. Previously, the kingdom of Judah under Ahaz had descended to the same level of disobedience as Israel (28:2, 6), whereas Israel’s leaders confessed their sins (28:13), indicating their readiness for restoration. The Chronicler then introduces Hezekiah, distinctively characterizing him as a second Solomon. Hezekiah invited the north to join in the first Passover of his reign, and many responded (30:11); a similar celebration had not been held since Solomon’s time (30:26). Hezekiah’s Passover provides a model for the restoration of Israel as a unified kingdom.\nThe Chronicler used his account of Israel’s history to teach his readers to maintain hope for a historical restoration of David’s kingdom—however remote such a possibility may have seemed—and to maintain holy lives and a righteous community in the meantime. The Chronicler makes it clear that the kingdom of Israel was not a mere human institution subject to the whims of political expediency. It was God’s kingdom, and God would ultimately restore it.",

    "content": "Ezra recounts God’s marvelous work in bringing many Israelites back to Jerusalem after seventy years of exile in Babylon. The restored community struggled to resist pagan influences, to rebuild the Temple, and to deal with sin in the lives of those who chose to follow the world’s values rather than God’s. In Ezra we see how God provides for and protects those who trust in him and faithfully obey his word.\nSetting\nAbout 130 years before Ezra came to Jerusalem in 458 BC, God punished Judah’s persistent wickedness by sending the Babylonians to destroy the city, demolish the Temple, and take thousands into exile (see 2 Kgs 25:1-30). While in exile in Babylon, the Israelites were able to build homes, have gardens, and live a fairly good life with some religious freedom (Jer 29:4-5). Some attained positions of power (Dan 3, 6).\nGod had promised to return his people to the holy land after seventy years (2 Chr 36:21; Jer 25:12; 29:10). Around 559 BC, the Persian prince Cyrus II subdued the Medes and fused them into what would become the Persian empire. Then, in 539 BC, the Persians defeated the Babylonians, paving the way for this promise to be fulfilled. In 538 BC, Cyrus began to allow the Jewish people to leave Babylon. Sheshbazzar led the first group of exiles to return to their homeland (Ezra 1:1-8).\nWhen the people of Israel and Judah had been deported to foreign lands, the Assyrians and Babylonians had settled other conquered peoples in the land of Israel. The returning Jewish exiles found these foreigners inhabiting the land that they sought to reclaim and rebuild. These foreigners claimed to worship the same God as the Jews, but they actually advocated a “melting pot” religion that combined pagan and Jewish ideas and practices. These foreigners wanted to worship with the returning Jews. The Jews recognized the spiritual compromise that would entail (4:3) and refused the foreigners any part in their community. As a result, the Jewish community experienced severe opposition from the foreigners living in the land. Although this stand led to many years of conflict and a delay in Temple reconstruction, the Exile had taught the Jews that compromising the purity of their faith would yield worse results.\nSeveral decades later, Ezra arrived in Jerusalem. He found that some of the Israelites had compromised their faith by marrying foreigners (9:1-2). God had expressly forbidden such marriage because it would inevitably lead to adopting pagan religious beliefs (Deut 7:3-4; Josh 23:12-13). This sin would surely bring God’s judgment if it were not confessed and rectified (9:13-15; 10:14). Ezra led the people to separate themselves from the pagans and renew their covenant with God (10:1-11).\nChronological Summary\nEzra retraces events in Judah from 538 to about 450 BC.\n538–536 BC.  After Cyrus’s decree allowing Jews to return to their homeland (538 BC, 1:1-4), a group of about 50,000 returnees set out for Jerusalem, where they reestablished the Jewish community, built a new altar (1:5–3:6), and began rebuilding the Temple (3:7-13). These Jews refused to compromise their beliefs by joining together with local unbelievers. Local opposition soon halted all progress in their rebuilding effort (4:1-5).\n520–515 BC.  Almost two decades later, God used the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to motivate his people to continue rebuilding the Temple (5:1–6:12). The Jews responded, and with support from Persia, the Temple was completed in 515 BC without further interference (see also Hag 1:2-6; Zech 4:9; 6:12-15; 8:9).\n486–445 BC.  The Jews later experienced opposition during their initial attempt to rebuild the city and its walls (Ezra 4:6-23).\n458 BC.  Ezra traveled to Jerusalem to administer government affairs (7:1-26). He learned that some people were not following the laws of Moses but were marrying unbelievers and defiling Israel. After Ezra interceded for God’s mercy, he led an official judicial investigation of this matter. Many Israelites repented of their sins and divorced their pagan wives (9:1–10:44).\n445 BC.  Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem and succeeded in rebuilding its walls amid much opposition and difficulty (see Neh 1–7).\nAuthorship\nTraditionally, Ezra and Nehemiah are considered a single book written by Ezra. As a scribe, Ezra would have had access to many of the official documents included in the book.\nSome also maintain that Ezra wrote Chronicles because the last verses in 2 Chronicles (2 Chr 36:22-23) are very similar to the first verses in Ezra (Ezra 1:1-3). The books have common vocabulary and similar theological viewpoints. Many scholars reject this conclusion, however, on the grounds that the linguistic and theological differences between Chronicles and Ezra—Nehemiah far outweigh the similarities.\nLanguage and Sources\nMost of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, but the book of Ezra contains two sections written in Aramaic (4:8–6:18 and 7:12-26), the common language of the Persian empire. The six official documents in these sections are: Rehum’s letter to King Artaxerxes (4:8-16), Artaxerxes’ letter to Rehum (4:17-22), Tattenai’s letter to King Darius (5:6-17), Cyrus’s decree to build the Temple in Jerusalem (6:3-5), Darius’s letter to Tattenai (6:6-12), and Artaxerxes’ letter to Ezra (7:12-26). The authentic character of these documents helps verify the historical truthfulness of Ezra’s account.\nEzra also includes several documents written in Hebrew: the decree of Cyrus (1:2-4); a list of Temple vessels (1:9-11); a list of the Israelites who first returned to Jerusalem (2:1-69); a list of those who returned with Ezra (8:1-14); a list of treasures Ezra brought to Jerusalem with him (8:26-27); and a list of the men who divorced pagan wives (10:18-44). These lists assured the Jewish people that Ezra kept accurate records. Only the original holy objects would be used in the Temple, only those on the official list of Israelites could worship at the Temple, and only the men who divorced pagan wives would be included in the holy people of God. By including these details, Ezra took great care to distinguish between what was holy and what was not.\nMeaning and Message\nThe people of God felt helpless as they returned to Jerusalem from exile in Babylon. They faced the threat of robbers on their long trip back to Jerusalem, opposition to their presence in Jerusalem from neighbors, an inability to influence Persian government policies, and the enormous task of rebuilding a nation in ruins. How could they follow God when so many things were out of their control? Ezra focuses on four key themes to explain how God accomplishes his will in the lives of his people.\n1. Everything that happens results from God’s sovereign control over Israel’s history.  God prompted Cyrus to allow the Jews to return to Jerusalem after seventy years of exile (Ezra 1:1-4). God also promised that treasures from other nations would flow to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple (Hag 2:7-8); this happened (Ezra 6:6-12) because God changed Darius’s heart (6:22). Later, when Ezra came to Jerusalem, God moved Artaxerxes to give Ezra everything he needed (7:6). And it was God who protected the Jews from attack as they traveled to Jerusalem (8:22, 31). Ezra recognized that the future of the nation was in God’s hand (9:6-15). Only a believer who is convinced that God is sovereign over this world will be able to remain faithful to God in the midst of conflict, difficulty, and discouragement.\n2. God’s people must be pure and separate from sinfulness in this world.  Ezra, a priest from the line of Aaron (7:1-5), was strong in his conviction regarding separateness. So were the early returnees who refused to cooperate with the local pagan people (4:1-5). While this led to many years of frustration and conflict, the people knew that they could not compromise the purity of their faith and still remain the people of God. When Ezra later arrived in Jerusalem, this commitment was not evident among those living there (9:1-2). Ezra recognized the crisis (9:3-15) and led the people to renew their covenant with God and to separate themselves from pagans (10:1-11).\n3. Following God’s word is of primary importance.  As a scribe, Ezra was determined to study and obey the law of God and to teach it to others (7:10). Ezra repeatedly explained his decisions by pointing to God’s instructions in Scripture. The king of Persia had instructed Ezra to teach and enforce the Mosaic laws (7:14, 23-25), and that is exactly what Ezra did (e.g., 8:35; 9:1–10:17).\n4. Intercessory prayer invites God’s compassion and power.  Ezra’s prayer of confession (9:6-15) is a model of humility in seeking God’s grace. Ezra knew that these sinful people would not be moved by a sternly worded sermon condemning them. Instead, he tore his clothes, wept, and mourned over the sinfulness of the nation. God powerfully used his confession to pierce the hearts of the people, and a great revival took place (9:6–10:17). Similarly, Ezra had earlier fasted and prayed for safety on their journey to Jerusalem, acknowledging that only God could protect them from attack (8:21-23, 31-32).",

    "content": "Nehemiah left a comfortable job as an assistant to the king of Persia in order to help the demoralized people of Jerusalem. His new work involved motivating the people to rebuild the city’s walls in spite of their neighbors’ opposition. Nehemiah’s work was not just with bricks and mortar. He also mediated a financial crisis, initiated religious reforms with the help of Ezra the scribe, and reorganized civic responsibilities in Jerusalem. Nehemiah demonstrated that with faith, prayer, integrity, and God’s help, God’s servants can succeed.\nSetting\nAfter the Jews had spent several decades in exile in Babylon, God caused the Persian king Cyrus to decree in 538 BC that they could return to their homeland to rebuild their sacred Temple (Ezra 1:2-4). About fifty thousand people returned to Jerusalem at that time. After arriving, they built an altar and joyfully worshiped God (Ezra 3:1-13).\nWhen they started rebuilding the rest of the Temple, the Jews were threatened by local people who had settled in the area. These opponents turned the Persian authorities against the Jews (Ezra 4:1-5). After fifteen years of frustration, work on the Temple finally began again during the reign of Darius I (521–486 BC), primarily through the prophetic encouragement of Haggai and Zechariah (Ezra 5:1-5). This time, the Persians fully supported the rebuilding of the Temple (Ezra 6:1-12).\nAbout sixty years later, in 458 BC, Ezra the scribe brought a group of several thousand more Jews to Jerusalem (Ezra 7:1–8:36). Before long, he learned that some of the leaders and priests had married wives who did not worship Israel’s God. Ezra saw this as a threat to the unity and purity of the nation, and he knew it would eventually cause God to punish the people with another exile from the land (Ezra 9:1-15). After Ezra’s emotional prayer confessing their sin, most of the others agreed that the intermarriage was wrong.\nEzra did not solve all the problems in Jerusalem. The people still did not have a secure city with rebuilt walls and gates. Numerous enemies still opposed their presence in Jerusalem. They needed a strong civic leader who could help them preserve the independence, economic vitality, security, and sanctity of Jerusalem. God sent a new leader, Nehemiah, to address these issues.\nSummary\nThe book of Nehemiah traces events from around 445 BC, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes I (2:1), until after 432 BC, the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes (13:6-7).\nNehemiah was the cup-bearer of King Artaxerxes of Persia (1:11). When Nehemiah heard about the ruined condition of Jerusalem (1:1-3), he earnestly prayed for God’s help. God’s answer came through Artaxerxes, who sent Nehemiah to Judah to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (ch 3). Nehemiah organized and motivated the people and led them with courage and integrity through times of resistance from outside enemies (4:1-23; 6:1-14) and conflict within the community (ch 5). Despite strong opposition (6:1-4), under Nehemiah’s leadership the people rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem in just fifty-two days (6:15).\nFollowing the completion of the walls, the account focuses on religious reforms led by Ezra and Nehemiah (7:73–10:39). At the annual Festival of Shelters, Ezra read to the crowd from the books of Moses (8:5-8), resulting in a revival and a long prayer of confession (9:5-37). During this revival, the Israelites committed not to intermarry with foreigners and not to profane the Sabbath (10:28-39).\nThe book’s final section (chs 11–13) describes Nehemiah’s civic efforts to resettle more people in Jerusalem (11), to dedicate the walls of Jerusalem (12:27-43), and to organize the gatekeepers and Temple storeroom attendants (12:44–13:5). After a time of absence, Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem (13:6-7). When he arrived, he took measures to ensure the purity of the Temple, and he again confronted the people concerning the Sabbath and intermarriage with people who worshiped other gods (13:10-28).\nAuthorship\nThe book itself does not identify its author. The Talmud (Baba Batra 15a) says that Ezra wrote both Ezra and Nehemiah, and this is the most likely possibility. Nehemiah 8–10 were probably from Ezra’s own memoirs. Ezra also adapted and arranged a variety of materials to suit his purposes, apparently including Nehemiah’s memoirs and his reports to the Persian court regarding the reconstruction progress in Jerusalem (Nehemiah 1–7 and 11–13).\nNehemiah shares several characteristics with the book of Ezra. Both Ezra (Ezra 1–6) and Nehemiah (Neh 1–7) describe the return of exiles to Jerusalem to complete a rebuilding project. Both books contain stories of neighbors opposing the rebuilding efforts. Most importantly, both Nehemiah and Ezra show how hard work and God’s help enabled the people to complete the construction of important structures in Jerusalem. Both books also tell of spiritual reforms in which the community listened to God’s word, repented of past failures, and instituted religious and social reforms (Ezra 9–10; Neh 8–10).\nSeveral events in Nehemiah have parallels in Ezra that are told in similar ways. There are stories about those who opposed the rebuilding (6:1-14; Ezra 4:1-23), processionals to celebrate dedications (12:31-43; Ezra 6:16-18), and similar reforms (13:15-29; Ezra 9:1–10:44). Like Ezra, Nehemiah has lists of names (3; 7:6-73; 10:1-27; 11:1–12:26) and at least one parenthetical section (7:6–10:39) followed by the resumption of a previous account (11:1-4). These factors lead many biblical scholars to believe that one author wrote both Ezra and Nehemiah.\nMeaning and Message\nPrayer.  Nehemiah based his service on prayer. He earnestly prayed for God to rescue the people from their despised situation, and God answered by sending Nehemiah (1:1–2:8). When foreigners opposed restoring the walls of Jerusalem, Nehemiah asked God to judge them (4:4-5; 6:14). Nehemiah prayed for divine support when he dealt with people who were driving fellow Jews into slavery (5:19), those who were not tithing (13:14), and people who were not keeping the Sabbath (13:22). Prayer provided the power to accomplish God’s will. Six times Nehemiah repeated a refrain asking the Lord to “remember” either him or his opponents (5:19; 6:14; 13:14, 22, 29, 31).\nGod’s Providence.  The book of Nehemiah emphasizes that God sovereignly controls the lives of individuals and nations. God is able to restore people from exile (1:8-9), to promote one of his servants to be the king’s cup-bearer and later the governor of a province (1:11; 2:8, 18), and to give success in rebuilding the walls (2:20; 6:16). God protects his people (4:4-5, 9, 20) and frustrates the plans of the wicked (4:14-15). The same God who created heaven and earth (9:6), called Abram from Ur, and gave the land to Israel (9:7-8) was able to accomplish his will through Nehemiah.\nDedication to God’s Word.  The authoritative law of Moses contained God’s instructions on how his people should live. God had made a “covenant of unfailing love with those who love him and obey his commands” (1:5). However, his people had not obeyed the instructions God gave to Moses (1:7-9), so they were in danger of God’s punishment. Ezra read publicly from the law of Moses (8:1-3) to restore the nation. In response, many of the people dedicated themselves to following the law by separating themselves from unbelievers (10:28), keeping the Sabbath, and giving their tithe for the Levites (10:29-39; 12:44).\nCourage against Opposition.  Nehemiah was courageous in dealing with opposition. Sanballat, Geshem, and Tobiah opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls (2:10) and mocked the work of God’s people (2:19; 4:1-3). In addition, Arabs, Ammonites, and people from Ashdod plotted to attack the builders (4:7-9, 11; 6:1-14). Nehemiah responded to this opposition by posting guards and praying for God’s help (4:6-23). Nehemiah also confronted internal conflict from members of the community who abused the poor (5:1-13), who married foreigners (9:1-2; 10:28-30; 13:23-28), and who did not tithe or keep the Sabbath holy (10:31-39; 13:10-22). Nehemiah’s courage and prayer enabled him to succeed in addressing these problems.",

    "content": "Esther’s rags-to-riches drama tells the story of a woman with wisdom, courage, and willingness who affected the lives of thousands. With a praying community of supporters, and with God providentially working in the background, Esther accepted her role and put her life on the line to save others.\nSetting\nThe book of Esther is set during the reign of King Xerxes of Persia (486–465 BC). In a previous generation (538 BC), about 50,000 people had returned to Judea from Babylonia (Ezra 1:1-5; 2:64-67). But many Jewish families, including Esther’s, had stayed behind.\nDuring Xerxes’ reign, the Persian empire was near its peak. Xerxes and his military had accomplished great things, including a decisive victory over Egypt. Wealth from taxes poured into the Persian capital of Susa, and Xerxes oversaw the construction of a luxurious new palace at Persepolis. However, Xerxes was a tyrannical king. Esther entered Xerxes’ court and was chosen to be his queen. She was faced with the challenge of serving God and her people in a time of crisis while being the faithful wife of a pagan king.\nSummary\nWhen King Xerxes gave a lavish banquet for key leaders of Persia, Queen Vashti refused to show off her beauty, so Xerxes deposed her and searched for a new queen (1:1–2:4). Mordecai’s cousin Esther, a Jew, was chosen (2:5-18).\nAfter Mordecai became a palace official, he uncovered a plot against the king and reported it through Esther. On a later occasion Mordecai refused to bow to Haman, Xerxes’ highest official, which led to Haman’s vindictive plot to kill all the Jews in the empire (2:19–3:15). As the Jewish community prayed (4:16), Esther endangered her own life, approaching the king uninvited, and asked the king and Haman to come to a feast (ch 4). Haman, meanwhile, had built a pole so that he could impale Mordecai (5:14).\nAfter realizing that Mordecai had never been rewarded for uncovering the assassination plot, the king ordered that Haman lead a procession designed to honor Mordecai, a humiliating turn of events for Haman (ch 6). Then, at the banquet, Esther revealed that Haman’s plot was a personal attack on her people. Haman was impaled on his own poleput to death on his own gallows (ch 7).\nKing Xerxes then allowed the Jewish people to defend themselves against their enemies (8:1-14). The Jews rejoiced, Mordecai was promoted, and Haman’s sons were executed (9:1-17). The Jewish people then defended themselves successfully and celebrated God’s marvelous deliverance at the first Festival of Purim.\nAuthorship and Date\nThe text of Esther does not indicate who wrote the book or when it was written. Some early church fathers thought that Ezra wrote Esther, but Clement of Alexandria suggested Mordecai. Since there are many Persian words in the book and there is no Greek influence, the book was probably written between 460 BC (i.e., after the conclusion of Xerxes’ reign) and 331 BC (i.e., before Alexander the Great conquered Persia).\nGenre: History or Fiction?\nThe book of Esther is a biographical narrative similar to the account of Joseph (Gen 37–48) and the book of Ruth. Some question the historicity of this account because of the implausibility that (a) a Persian king would issue a decree for widespread extermination of the Jews, (b) the Jews would slaughter seventy-five thousand enemies in one day, (c) a non-Persian like Esther would be queen, and (d) a large number of improbable coincidences would take place.\nOn the other hand, the historical accuracy of the book is supported because (a) the book uses authentic Persian names, titles, and customs; (b) elsewhere God works behind the scenes to use improbable coincidences to his glory (e.g., Gen 37–48; Ruth 1–4); (c) Esther hid her identity as a Jew until long after she became queen; and (d) kings do not usually oppose the slaughter of their enemies, especially at the suggestion of their highest officials.\nAdditions to the Book of Esther\nThe Hebrew text of Esther is defined by a strong and consistent Hebrew manuscript tradition. Nevertheless, the Targums and Midrash (interpretation and commentary on the Hebrew Old Testament), the Greek Old Testament, the Latin Vulgate, and Josephus (a first-century Roman Jewish historian) all include additional stories that are not included in the Hebrew text but were composed later. The additions mention God numerous times, whereas the Hebrew text does not. None of the additions contain authoritative original information; some just repeat information from the Hebrew version of Esther, while some contradict information. Other additions are based on the imagination of later authors. Instead of inserting these additions where they fit chronologically and making them look like an authentic part of the story, Jerome, who translated and edited the Latin Vulgate, collected them together at the end of the Old Testament in the deuterocanonical books, which are included in Roman Catholic and Orthodox translations.\nMeaning and Message\nAlthough the book of Esther never mentions God, its central purpose is to demonstrate that God works providentially to take care of his people. God used Xerxes’ drunken arrogance to elevate Esther to a position of influence (chs 1–2). Haman’s evil plans to kill the Jews were brought back on his own head through a series of unique and ironic circumstances, and the day of execution became a day of joy for God’s people. The book of Esther reminds us that God providentially directs people and events to accomplish his purposes.",

    "content": "When suffering comes to us, we often ask why. People sometimes say it’s because the sufferer did something wrong. The book of Job examines the suffering of one man who suffered precisely because he was blameless. Job’s friends supposed that he was guilty of some unknown sin. They tried to persuade him to repent, but Job knew he hadn’t sinned, so he questioned God. Finally, God appeared, but he did not give Job the answers he sought. Instead, God confronted Job, changed his perspective, and blessed him.\nSetting\nThe book of Job unfolds early in the patriarchal age, before Israel became a nation. Job’s wealth, like Abraham’s, was in livestock and slaves (1:3; 42:12; see Gen 12:16; 32:5). He was his family’s priest, as was a common practice before the law of Moses (1:5; 42:8; see Gen 4:4; 8:20; 12:7-8; 13:18; 15:9-10; 26:25; 33:20; 35:1-6; 46:1). During Job’s time, the Sabeans and Chaldeans were nomadic raiders (1:15, 17), not important political and economic powers as in the late monarchical period (cp. Isa 45:14; Joel 3:8). The money used by Job and his relatives was called the kesitah, which was used during the patriarchal age (42:11; see Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32). Only those who lived before the flood (Gen 1–6) and the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) matched or exceeded Job’s longevity (42:16; see Gen 5:3-32; 25:7; 35:28; 47:28; 50:26). With Job, we return to the beginning of history, when mortals first struggled to know God and understand the world.\nSummary\nThe prose introduction to the book of Job (chs 1–2) provides the heavenly perspective on Job’s suffering and sets the context for the human dialogue that forms most of the work. Job was a righteous man whom God allowed Satan to test. In the heavenly courtroom, Satan argued that if God removed his blessings from Job, he would “surely curse you to your face” (1:11). Instead, Job responded, “Praise the name of the Lord!” (1:21), and, “Should we accept only good things from the hand of God and never anything bad?” (2:10). God’s praise for Job was vindicated.\nThe reader then leaves the court of heaven and enters the council of humans as three of Job’s friends come to sympathize with him. Their silent, seven-day vigil is apparently a genuine attempt to console Job (2:11-13). However, when Job breaks his silence with a bitter complaint (ch 3), his counselors begin to criticize and condemn him. In three rounds of debate (chs 4–27), their rhetoric varies from innuendo to blatant accusation. Job’s friends argue a tight theological case: Since God is righteous, he rewards each person according to what that person has done; therefore, Job’s suffering must be the just punishment for some evil he has committed. Job responds to each of their speeches by insisting that he is innocent and that his suffering is undeserved and unfair.\nAfter the three rounds of dialogue between Job and his friends, a poetic interlude praises God as the sole source of wisdom (ch 28). When Job then makes his final statement about both his misery and his righteousness (chs 29–31), his three friends give up on him (32:1). Elihu, a new voice, then renews the human struggle to explain Job’s suffering (chs 32–37). Finally, God arrives to challenge Job (chs 38–41). Instead of hearing Job’s case, God demands answers and poses questions that demonstrate his own power and sovereignty. Job responds with repentance and acknowledges that he does not have the right to question God (42:1-6).\nIn the final prose section (42:7-17), God reaffirms Job’s righteousness and faithfulness, pronounces judgment on Job’s friends, and pours out tremendous blessings on Job.\nJob as History\nThe heavenly setting of the book’s opening and the manifestation of the supernatural at its closing tempt the modern reader to cast the book of Job as a fictional parable. The poetic dialogues also suggest that it is something more than just a dry historical record. But history can be described in flights of poetry just as well as in detailed narrative (cp. Exod 14:21-31; 15:1-12; Pss 78; 105). The biblical record elsewhere suggests that the account of Job is historical. Both Ezekiel and James referred to Job as an example of righteousness and endurance (Ezek 14:14, 20; Jas 5:11).\nAuthor and Date of Composition\nThe authorship and composition of Job is a riddle. Although the story has a patriarchal setting (around 2000 BC), the date of its composition appears to be much later. Commentators have suggested dates that range from the era of Israel’s wilderness wanderings (Exodus—Numbers) to the era following the return from exile (Ezra—Nehemiah). The final composition of Job probably took place during the monarchy (1–2 Kings), when other wisdom materials such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes were being accumulated.\nEven if we accept that Job was a historical character, we still do not know who the author was, where he lived, or what level of society he came from. The author appears to have been a sage who was skilled in the use of proverbs (e.g., 4:2; 6:5-6), rhetorical questions (e.g., 21:29), and the art of eloquence. He also knew about plant and animal life, foreign culture, and antiquity, including the patriarchal period.\nThe book cannot be dated with certainty by reference to (1) events or people mentioned or implied in the book (the earliest reference to Job is during the Exile, Ezek 14:14, 20); (2) theological ideas in the book that point to distinct dates; or (3) its textual relationship to other material in the Old Testament (e.g., cp. 3:3-10; Jer 20:14-18). Job may even have been edited over a period of time by a number of different people.\nLiterary Characteristics\nAncient Parallels to Job.  The book of Job has several parallels in ancient Near Eastern literature (The following list of parallels is based on James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament , 3rd ed. [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]):\n• The Canaanite “Legend of King Keret” tells of a king who loses his family in a series of natural disasters; his god El restores his family.\n• The Egyptian document “Dispute over Suicide” (2000s BC) tells of a man who considers suicide and hopes that someone will take up his case with the heavenly council. (Job wishes he had never been born, but he never considers suicide.)\n• Also from Egypt, “Protests of the Eloquent Peasant” (2200s BC) tells the story of a robbery victim who is not treated justly and appeals to local authorities. At first he is polite, but as he keeps presenting his case, his language becomes increasingly strident.\n• From Babylonia, the story “I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom” tells of a pious man of high rank who is struck with illness and mocked by friends. Unlike Job, this man believes that he has committed some accidental sin, perhaps something that he never thought was wrong. Rather than maintain his innocence, he acknowledges his guilt and begs for mercy. After a series of exorcisms that bring healing, his god restores his fortunes. In gratitude, he concludes with a long hymn of praise to his god.\n• Also from Babylonia, the “Babylonian Theodicy” follows the same dialogue form that the book of Job uses: The sufferer complains, and his friends respond with rebukes. The arguments on both sides are remarkably similar to those in Job. Yet we also see key differences: (1) The “Babylonian Theodicy” is polytheistic, whereas Job is monotheistic; (2) its sufferer threatens to abandon his faith and give up obedience, even as he ends with a petition to his god and goddess. Job remains committed to the Lord throughout (e.g., Job 13:15-16).\nRelationship to Israel’s Wisdom Literature.  The book of Job has the flavor of other works of Old Testament wisdom literature. Job’s friends follow lines of thought spelled out in Deuteronomy, Chronicles, and Proverbs. They argue that wisdom and righteousness lead to life and prosperity, while folly and wickedness lead to death and failure. Job joins the author of Ecclesiastes in questioning the simplistic, universal application of this doctrine.\nMeaning and Message\nThe book of Job does not explain suffering. That is not its purpose. But it does demonstrate that suffering is not necessarily God’s retribution for sin. Job does not get an answer as to why bad things happen to good people, and neither do we.\nThe central conflict of the book is between the integrity of the Creator and the integrity of a man. Heaven and earth appear to be at odds. It is too easy simply to line up with Job’s three friends in denying Job’s innocence, as we can appeal to various New Testament passages that deny that any human is righteous (e.g., Rom 3:10, 23; Luke 18:19). Job’s righteousness is genuine and thorough, though his obsession with his own rectitude sometimes borders on self-righteousness. He grows so adamant in defending his integrity that he seems ready to defy God. Job’s three friends set out a view of God that is more orthodox, at least on the surface. These counselors are more than weak, imaginary straw men; they accurately develop most of the biblical ways of explaining suffering. But their presumptuous applications go sour. They insist on a quid pro quo view of retribution, in which all the good and evil that people experience is directly related to what they have earned or deserved.\nThe book works within the basic commitments of Old Testament Israel’s faith. Job and all of the other speakers take seriously the covenantal ideas of blessing and cursing (Lev 26; Deut 28) and of sowing and reaping in this life (Ps 34:11-22; see also Gal 6:7; 1 Pet 3:10). They don’t even consider solutions to the problem of why God permits the righteous to suffer (theodicy) from outside the scope of biblical revelation (e.g., metaphysical dualism, polytheistic tensions, or materialistic naturalism). Instead, the book’s speakers explore only biblical answers. They explain the meaning of suffering as (1) punishment for sin (e.g., Job 4:7-9); (2) the inevitable lot of mortals, who tend toward sin (e.g., 15:14-16); (3) God’s discipline (e.g., 5:17-18; 33:15-28; 36:8-15; see Prov 3:11; Heb 12:2-13); (4) part of God’s mysterious plan (e.g., Job 11:7-8; 37:19, 23); or (5) a test imposed on earth to satisfy a heavenly dispute (e.g., 1:6-12).\nSince life “under the sun” (see Ecclesiastes) is an arena too small to provide answers to all the great questions, the writer looks to the courts of heaven for a divine dimension to what takes place on earth. But the answer is not disclosed even there. Why did God entertain Satan’s challenge in the first place?\nIn the end, the book of Job shows God defending Job’s innocence and rejecting easy explanations of suffering. God also rejects Job’s demands for an explanation. Since Job could not possibly understand the whole universe, he should not demand an explanation of how his suffering fits into that order. The world cannot be explained in terms that humans can fully understand.\nThe book of Job thus offers a complex picture of God. He could have rejected Satan’s suggestion, having nothing to prove; yet he chose to allow the test, ultimately demonstrating his power and bringing defeat to Satan through the human Job. God never explains to Job what is happening behind the scenes. Instead, God challenges Job’s right to question the integrity of divine justice (40:8).\nThe way to live through calamities is not just to keep a stiff upper lip but to bow reverently before God and trust his sovereign goodness. In a day of calamity, humans can respond to God by worshiping him and acknowledging the wisdom and justice of his ways, regardless of how harsh the pain or dark the confusion. God’s holy purposes for human suffering are sometimes hidden. In the end, Job draws closer to God through his suffering: “I had only heard about you before, but now I have seen you with my own eyes” (42:5).",

    "content": "Jesus and the apostles loved the book of Psalms—they quoted from it and lived out of it. These ancient prayers and praises of Israel provide a bridge between the Old Testament and the New Testament; the themes introduced in the psalms find further development in the New Testament. Where David’s dynasty failed, Jesus gives hope. Yet, certain expectations that emerge in the book of Psalms still remain for the future, namely that God’s people will completely fulfill his purposes and that all nations will submit to the Messiah.\nSummary\nThe psalms, like all Scripture, are inspired and given by God (see 2 Tim 3:16). Yet each psalm originated with a human author as a prayer or praise to the Lord. The psalms are diverse: The Psalter includes laments, praise psalms, wisdom, thanksgiving, reflections on God’s actions, celebrations of God’s revelation, and worship.\nThe first two psalms serve as an introduction to the entire Psalter (the book of Psalms). Psalm 1 describes a godly person who delights in God, lives by divine instruction, and is not influenced by evildoers. Psalm 1 points to three questions: (1) Is there forgiveness for sins? (2) Why do the godly suffer? and (3) Why do the wicked prosper? The rest of the Psalter meditates on these questions.\nPsalm 2 speaks of how the nations and the wicked are in rebellion against God’s rule. God judges the rebellious and protects the godly. Psalm 2 suggests two questions: (1) Why do the rebellious nations and the wicked prosper? and (2) Why were the kings of David’s line not victorious?\nThe psalmists largely wrestle with these questions. Some quietly accept their problems, while others question God or become exasperated. Meanwhile, new questions and issues develop out of their dialogues with God.\nThe Composition of the Psalms\nFor a thousand years, poets wrote these poems while people recited and collected them. The Temple liturgy encouraged both the writing and the collection of psalms. Gradually, editors incorporated smaller collections into larger collections, shaping five collections into the one book of Psalms. The process of editing the Psalter into one book took place over time and was completed following the exile to Babylon. There are several markers of this editorial activity:\n1. The editors placed Psalms 1 and 2 as an introduction to the whole book of Psalms. Both psalms give idealized portraits: Psalm 1 portrays the ideal godly person who lives by God’s instruction. Psalm 2 portrays the Messiah, the ideal king of Israel. The rest of the Psalter develops and deepens these portraits, while at the same time exploring how neither the people of God nor their king were able to fulfill God’s ideals and bring about the happiness and peace of God’s kingdom.\n2. Individual psalms were collected in groups. The editors arranged these groupings of psalms into five collections: Book One (Pss 1–41, with a doxology in 41:13), Book Two (Pss 42–72, with a doxology in 72:19), Book Three (Pss 73–89, with a doxology in 89:52), Book Four (Pss 90–106, with a doxology in 106:48), and Book Five (Pss 107–150, without a doxology).\n3. Books One (Pss 1–41) and Two (Pss 42–72) form the first stage of the collection. The shift from David in Book One (Pss 3–32; 34–41) to collections of psalms by various authors in Book Two (the descendants of Korah, Pss 42–49; Asaph, Ps 50; David, Pss 51–65; 68–70; Solomon, Ps 72) reveals a thematic transition from David as the sole model and teacher to other perspectives. At the end of Book Two, the editor comments, “This ends the prayers of David son of Jesse” (72:20). This comment remained in place even when Books Three, Four, and Five (with additional psalms of David) were added to the collection.\n4. Book Three (Pss 73–89) shares with Book Two its preference of the name Elohim for God (Pss 42–83) and its diversity of authors (Asaph, Pss 73–83; the descendants of Korah, Pss 84–85; 87–88; David, Ps 86). Psalm 73, which opens Book Three, questions God’s justice and power, thus calling into doubt the magnificent vision of the messianic kingdom outlined in the final psalm of Book Two (Ps 72). This questioning returns in Psalm 89, at the close of Book Three.\n5. The psalms of Book Four (Pss 90–106) wrestle with questions raised at the time of the Exile, when it seemed that God’s covenant with David had been dissolved (see Ps 89). In response to this crisis, several psalms encourage individual growth in character and godliness (see Pss 91–92). Most psalms in this collection present God as the true and faithful king whose kingdom extends to every part of creation (Pss 93–100). He still loves his people, the flock of his pasture (Ps 100), but they have to listen to him (Pss 95; 100). God is the source of forgiveness, and his compassion assures his exiled people that he still cares for them. The review of redemption history from creation to the Exile (Pss 104–106) underscores both God’s wisdom and Israel’s folly as a framework for understanding the Exile.\n6. The benediction of Psalm 106:48 is also included in 1 Chronicles 16:36 and might indicate that Book Four was completed in the postexilic era (when Chronicles was compiled).\n7. Book Five (Pss 107–150) includes a number of smaller collections: the Egyptian Hallel (Pss 113–118); the Torah Psalm (Ps 119); the Great Hallel (Pss 120–136), which includes the Songs of Ascents (Pss 120–134); eight psalms of David (Pss 138–145); and five concluding hymns of praise (Pss 146–150). Book Five sets out the thematic progression of affliction, lament, God’s rescue, and praise. The opening psalm (Ps 107) begins this pattern, and its final verse (107:43) points to the importance of wisdom in discerning God’s ways. Psalm 119, the longest psalm, celebrates the wisdom of God and the word of God. The psalms recounting the Lord’s historic care for Israel in the wilderness (Pss 114–118; 135–136) prepare exilic and postexilic Israel to read David’s final prayers (Pss 138–145) in a new light: David looked forward to God’s kingdom (Ps 145). The psalms of praise affirm this hope (Pss 146–150).\n8. Additions appear to have been made to already-existing psalms. This may explain the prayer for the restoration of Zion (51:18-19) and for God’s blessing on Jerusalem (69:34-36). Changes in circumstances may have occasioned the addition of new stanzas.\n9. The available manuscripts reveal some flexibility in the organization and titles of the psalms. Both the Hebrew and Greek editions of the Psalter contain 150 psalms, but with differing divisions and numbering as well as differences regarding which psalms have titles. The Greek text combines both Psalms 9 and 10 and Psalms 114 and 115 into one psalm each, but it splits both Psalms 116 and 147 into two. Differences between the Hebrew and English numbering are indicated in the notes.\nBy the time of Jesus, the collected Psalter was well known (see Luke 20:42; Acts 1:20). It was part of the third section of the Hebrew canon, called the Writings (see Luke 24:44).\nAuthorship\nMany of the psalms are associated with David, but not all; in fact, less than half are explicitly connected with him. Others are connected with Asaph (Pss 50; 73–83), the descendants of Korah (Pss 42–49; 84–85; 87), Solomon (Pss 72; 127), Heman (Ps 88), Ethan (Ps 89), and Moses (Ps 90).\nOf the 116 psalms with a title, most identify a person who is linked to that psalm. The person named may be the author, but not necessarily. The Hebrew preposition le before the name (often translated “of”) can also mean “for,” “dedicated to,” “concerning,” “to,” or “by.” So, ledawid (often translated “of David”) could be interpreted as “for David,” “dedicated to David,” “concerning David,” or “by David.” While many psalms “of David” may have been written by him, there are several reasons for caution. The titles occasionally have two names, such as David and Jeduthun or Asaph (Pss 39, 62, 77). It is possible that the other individual was the actual author of the psalm. Furthermore, the psalms whose titles connect them with an episode of David’s life (Pss 3, 7, 18, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, 142) provide little or no specific connection with those episodes. For example, the title in Psalm 51 connects the psalm with David’s sin and Nathan’s rebuke. The psalm speaks of sin, forgiveness, and a broken spirit, but any specifics of the situation are notoriously absent. In addition, several psalms “of David” seem to assume the existence of the Temple, which was not constructed until after David’s death (see Ps 5:7; 122:title; 138:2). Similarly, the title of Psalm 30 connects David with the dedication of the Temple, and Psalm 69 does not seem to fit with what is known of David’s life. Finally, some textual traditions vary in the mention of David in the heading (e.g., Pss 122, 124). It is possible, therefore, that ledawid should be understood in many cases as meaning “for/dedicated to/concerning David” rather than “by David.” Such psalms evoke his persona as the chief representative of the dynasty without implying that he himself was the author. Still, there are many psalms that could have been authored by David.\nLiterary Issues\nThe title Psalms comes from the Greek word psalmos (“song”; see Luke 20:42; 24:44), which translates the Hebrew mizmor, a word frequently found in the titles of individual psalms (e.g., see Ps 3:title, translated “psalm”). The word mizmor is related to a verb meaning “to play a stringed instrument.” The psalms were originally accompanied by instruments and were part of the oral tradition of Israel before they were collected. The Hebrew title of the Psalter is tehillim (“praises”), a word that is related to hallelujah (“praise Yahweh”).\nPsalm Titles.  The psalm titles, or short superscriptions accompanying most of the psalms, give information such as the author, the type of psalm (e.g., song, prayer), a musical notation, the use of the psalm, a historical context, or a dedication. Much of the information is not well understood, so many scholars do not emphasize the psalm titles in the interpretation of the psalms.\nIn Hebrew editions, the psalm titles are typically numbered as verse 1. As a result, the verse numbers for many entire psalms differ by one from most English translations.\nInterlude (Hebrew Selah).  This word is found throughout the book of Psalms. The meaning of the word is uncertain, though it is probably a musical or literary term. In the NLT it is consistently rendered Interlude.\nGroupings of the Psalms.  The psalms can be grouped in a number of ways:\n• By the names they use for God: Yahweh (“the Lord,” Pss 1–41) and Elohim (“God,” Pss 42–72).\n• By the names in the titles: David (Pss 3–32; 34:1–41:13, etc.), the descendants of Korah (Pss 42–49; 84:1–85:13; 87:1–88:18), and Asaph (Pss 50, 73-83).\n• By genre (see below).\n• By the collections of which they are already a part: e.g., the Songs of Ascents (Pss 120–134). Other collections were recognized in Jewish tradition, such as the Egyptian Hallel (Pss 113–118) and the hallelujah hymns (Pss 146–150).\n• By thematic connections: e.g., God’s kingship (Pss 93–100), or the storyline from creation to the Exile (Pss 104–106).\nGenres of the Psalms.  The psalm titles often designate the genre of a psalm. The most frequent genre designation in the titles is the Hebrew term mizmor, referring to a song originally accompanied by stringed instruments. Less frequent are the words maskil (meaning “psalm” or “chant”: Pss 32; 42; 44-45; 52-55; 74; 88–89), miktam (“psalm” or “chant”: Pss 16; 56-60), shir (“song”: Pss 45; 120-135), shiggayon (“psalm,” a generic or musical term: Ps 7), tepillah (“prayer”: Pss 17; 86; 90), tehillah (“psalm of praise”: Ps 145), higgayon (“meditation,” meaning unknown: Ps 9:16), and todah (“psalm of thanksgiving”: Ps 100).\nIn addition to the genre identifications that are found in the Hebrew text, the psalms may be divided into three main categories:\n1. Wisdom or instructional psalms (Pss 1, 15, 24, 33, 34, 37, 73, 90, 107)\n2. Psalms of lament (most psalms in books 1—3), which can be subdivided into individual laments and community laments\n3. Hymns of praise or thanksgiving (Pss 8, 19, 29, 65, 67, 114), which can similarly be divided into individual and community hymns\nThe psalms of praise include several subgenres, including “royal” psalms about the king (Pss 2, 45, 72, 89, 110); psalms ascribing kingship to the Lord (Pss 93, 95-99); hymns about creation (Pss 19, 29, 104); and hymns about Zion (Pss 46, 48, 84, 87).\nAnother way of reading the psalms is based on the movement in many psalms from instruction to a problem and from a problem to a renewal in commitment and character. The Psalter as a collection of five books is largely instructional in nature. It is “instruction” (torah; see 1:2) and has the purpose of teaching God’s people how to live.\nThe Psalms in Israel’s Worship\nThe book of Psalms contains much information on music making in ancient Israel. The majority of psalms are songs of praise, thanksgiving, prayer, and repentance. Some of the psalms were used on specific occasions, such as at Passover (Pss 113–118, or when journeying to Jerusalem for the annual festivals (Pss 120–134. There are also historic odes that relate great national events (for example, Ps 30, “a song for the dedication of the Temple,” and Ps 137, which portrays the sufferings of the Jews in captivity). Such psalms played a role in the life of the community; however, the exact nature of that role is uncertain.\nMeaning and Message\nThe psalms provide windows into the souls of the ancient saints who wrote them. Their theological reflections are not easy or simple-minded, but the psalmists’ faith, when tried, is purified.\nThe psalms model depth of character, wisdom, honesty, and authenticity. But the prayers in the Psalter are more than models to be imitated. They are God’s instructions for righteous living, part of his torah (“instruction”; see Pss 1; 19; 119). God teaches who he is, what he has done, and what he expects from his people. The psalms are God-centered, instructing his people to discern error in themselves, to receive his correction, and to be like him. They also encourage God’s people to worship him vibrantly and to bear witness about him to the world.\nThe psalmists reflected on the transitory nature of life, on suffering, and on the many kinds of adversity that human beings experience. As the psalmists faced alienation and pain, they longed for God’s presence, provision, and protection (e.g., Ps 23), and for a lasting glory. Even the psalms connected with David often reveal a humble rather than a victorious David—humiliated rather than glorious. The psalmists experienced alienation and shame, and they longed for redemption, trusting in the Lord to vindicate them.\nThe Psalter illustrates the failures of Israel and of David’s dynasty. The best of the godly Israelites and kings were unable to bring the happiness and peace that Psalms 1 and 2 speak of (see also Ps 72). The psalms are thus God’s exhortation to each person to cultivate wisdom, to trust in him, to live by grace, and to have hope in the one who can bring blessings to a needy world.\nThe psalms prepare God’s people for the coming of Jesus Christ as the perfect human and ideal king, the descendant of David who has absolute integrity. Jesus and the apostles understood Jesus’ life and ministry in light of the psalms (see Matt 13:34-35; 21:16, 42; 23:39; John 2:17; 15:25; 19:24, 28, 36; Acts 2:22-35; 4:11; 13:32-38; Rom 15:3; 1 Cor 15:25-27; Eph 4:7-10; 1 Pet 2:7). Jesus entered the world of humans and lived out the patterns found in the psalms, including humiliation, suffering, death, vindication, and glory. He is the only human being who has completely pleased God (Ps 1). He is the Messiah and King (Ps 2) who has become our means of redemption, happiness, and peace.",

    "content": "Each day, life confronts us with many decisions. The book of Proverbs is a compass that helps us navigate the murky waters of life. It provides wisdom, instructions for living, and guidance for achieving strong character. Proverbs tells us how to succeed in any situation by remaining calm-headed in a crisis, patient when pressed, gentle when challenged, and firm when confronted with temptation. Above all, Proverbs shows us that the source of all wisdom is a right relationship with God.\nSetting\nProverbs is a collection of sayings from various times and social contexts. Many individual proverbs find their primary setting in the royal court, addressing matters such as how to act in front of a king. Some proverbs have a family setting and best fit an agricultural context. Others pertain to the world of commerce, trade, and business. Much of Proverbs is directed toward a young man who seems to be at the age of beginning a profession. Proverbs offers wisdom and guidance for success in all the spheres of life that a person in ancient Israel might face. Yet it is also timeless, with significant application to readers today.\nSummary\nProverbs is ancient Israel’s anthology of wise sayings, advice, instructions, and warnings. The book has two major sections: It begins with talks that a father gives to his son (chs 1–9). These are followed by collections of wise sayings (chs 10–31) from a variety of authors on a wide range of topics; most frequently mentioned are wealth and poverty, planning, laziness, prostitutes, hard work, relationships, pride, and humility.\nGenre and Style\nWise Sayings.  In the ancient Near East, wise sayings were collected into anthologies for people to consult for guidance on a correct course of action. In Israel, as in neighboring nations, the purpose of these collections was to educate the young and give them direction for living well. Evidence suggests that Babylonian and Egyptian wisdom collections were incorporated in the curriculum of schools.\nA proverb expresses an insight, observation, or piece of advice that has been popularly accepted as general truth. Often, uttering the right proverb at the appropriate time is all it takes to resolve a discussion.\nHebrew Poetry.  Proverbs is also poetry. Its compact language holds a lot of content in few words. It is literature that rewards reflective time and meditation on its rich nuances. Many proverbs teach through poetic imagery. For example, laziness is discouraged through the use of a comparison with common irritants:\nLazy people irritate their employers,\nlike vinegar to the teeth or smoke in the eyes (10:26).\nOne important characteristic of Hebrew poetry is parallelism. Many proverbs use synonymous parallelism—the second part continues and sharpens the thought of the first part:\nThe king is pleased with words from righteous lips;\nhe loves those who speak honestly (16:13).\nOther proverbs are antithetical, meaning that the first and second parts are opposites:\nA wise woman builds her home,\nbut a foolish woman tears it down with her own hands (14:1).\nStill other proverbs make comparisons:\nBetter to have little, with fear for the Lord,\nthan to have great treasure and inner turmoil (15:16).\nAwareness of these elements of Hebrew poetry enhances one’s ability to understand and interpret the proverbs.\nAuthorship\nProverbs was begun by Solomon (1:1), a wise king (1 Kgs 3:5-15) who collected wise sayings and composed his own (1 Kgs 4:29-32). Material written or edited by later teachers was then added. For example, two hundred years after Solomon, “the advisers of King Hezekiah of Judah” collected additional proverbs of Solomon and added them to the anthology (Prov 25:1). Other composers or editors mentioned in Proverbs include Agur (30:1), Lemuel (31:1), and “the wise” (22:17; 24:23).\nSome of the sayings are influenced by neighboring nations, such as the “thirty sayings” of the wise (22:17–24:22), which appear to have borrowed heavily from an Egyptian writing called The Instruction of Amenemope (around 1100 BC). Proverbs was edited to its final form several hundred years after Solomon’s time.\nReaders\nProverbs 1:8–9:18 contains a series of discourses from a father to a son. There is some debate as to whether this was a biological son or an apprentice since the recipient of the Egyptian Instruction of Amenemope was an apprentice. However, the presence of the “mother” in Proverbs (e.g., 1:8) suggests a biological son.\nMuch of the material is more appropriate for young males than for women (such as warnings to avoid immoral women), yet Proverbs has a much broader audience than just young men. Its purpose is to teach wisdom to people (1:2), both to the simple (1:4) and to the wise (1:5). Proverbs is addressed to everyone—but not everyone will receive it (1:7).\nMeaning and Message\nProverbs is a book of practical wisdom for life. It often takes the form of a father teaching his son. As the son walks the path of life, he will come to crossroads where he must make decisions about which way to go.\nThe book of Proverbs helps us to make right choices today. It teaches that there are rewards for wise behavior and punishments for foolish behavior. But while these rewards motivate us to heed instruction, they are not universal promises. Proverbs offers principles that are generally true, but these principles do not always guarantee a favorable outcome. For example, a person who works hard and has integrity is likely to have more material resources than a lazy and shiftless person. However, a lazy person might inherit wealth, and a hard worker might lose wealth when exploited by a corrupt government official. (This disjunction between righteousness and material reward is a major theme of Job and Ecclesiastes.)\nThe advice of Proverbs sometimes seems to contradict itself, but wisdom and careful reading reveal the circumstances to which each piece of advice applies. Should we answer a fool’s arguments? Or should we be silent when we realize that we are arguing with a fool (26:4-5)? It depends. We find the same thing with English aphorisms. On some occasions “Look before you leap” applies; other times we are reminded that “He who hesitates is lost.” Contradictory sayings might both be true in different situations. The truly wise person knows when to apply a particular proverb and when not to.\nThe wisdom of Proverbs is practical, but the sayings contain much more than good advice. Real wisdom is based on a reverent, faith-filled relationship with God, who is the true source of all wisdom. This message is expressed in 1:7: “Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge.” Proverbs invokes a fundamental spiritual choice, because there is no true wisdom apart from a living relationship with God.",

    "content": "Ecclesiastes challenges us to think deeply about basic questions. Life and all it contains appears to be a meaningless vapor, here today and gone tomorrow. Even so, life need not be without purpose. Ecclesiastes recommends wisdom, righteous living, finding purpose in remembering our Creator, and keeping God’s commands. Then we can experience joy in the life God has given us.\nSetting\nWhen Israel was in its golden years of peace after David had established his empire, Solomon devoted time and energy to enhancing culture. He developed international commerce, diplomacy, and agriculture, and he built cities, fortresses, and the Temple. He advanced his nation culturally with material prosperity and profound literature. Rather than war against other nations, Solomon engaged them and their literature and incorporated their modes of cultural expression into Israel’s relationship with the Lord. Solomon’s failures are well known, but he accomplished much good with his wisdom, and he left his instructions on managing life wisely.\nSummary\nThe book of Ecclesiastes is a discourse or set of discourses exploring the value of life and all it contains and what people should do. The collection is bound by the editor’s very brief prologue (1:1) and his epilogue and conclusion (12:9-14). Within this framework are the words of “the Teacher” (Hebrew Qoheleth, which is how most commentators refer to him).\nThe Teacher explores a wide range of topics, such as time, work, wisdom, pleasure, and injustice. He repeatedly returns to one major theme: Life and all it contains is hebel (“vapor,” often translated “meaningless”). He discusses how humans should deal with life circumstances in a world that is under God’s sovereign rule. This discussion is summed up by the editor at the close of the book: “Here now is my final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone’s duty. God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad” (12:13-14).\nAuthor and Recipients\nThe main speaker is identified as a king, as “the Teacher,” and as David’s son (see 1:1, 12, 16; 2:7, 9); these labels strongly point to Solomon. His speech is framed within the opening and closing comments of an editor (1:1; 12:9-14), who reveres the wise Teacher and adds a bit of his own helpful advice.\nThe term translated “the Teacher” (Hebrew Qoheleth) is literally “[the one who] gathers an assembly or congregation.” This idea is expressed in the Greek title of the book, Ecclesiastes (from Greek ekklēsia, “assembly, congregation”). On at least one occasion, Solomon addressed an assembly of leaders and representatives of Israel’s tribes (see 2 Chr 5:2–7:7). We are also told that many kings and ambassadors came to hear Solomon speak because of his wisdom (1 Kgs 4:34; 10:23-24). Perhaps the content of Ecclesiastes was delivered publicly on one or more such occasions.\nEcclesiastes as Wisdom Literature\nEcclesiastes is one of the wisdom books, along with Job and Proverbs. Wisdom literature emphasizes pleasing God beyond the requirements of the law. These books identify ways for God’s people to be successful as individuals and to enhance the general success of society. The Teacher in Ecclesiastes speaks of wisdom as a general understanding of how God and the world work, learned through lifelong investigation. His conclusions are the subject of his lecture.\nMeaning and Message\nIn this discourse, the Teacher addresses the most significant question of life: Is anything ultimately meaningful? If we are a momentary shadow or a fleeting breath, how can our lives have meaning?\nThe Teacher contextualizes this philosophical question within the real world of government and everyday life through which administrators and ordinary citizens must navigate. His message is unified, and the editor summarizes its implications (12:13-14): Life and all it contains is fleeting and apparently fraught with futility. Everything in this world is temporary, and life’s frustrations could lead to the conclusion that it is meaningless. What we do doesn’t last, and we can’t find meaning in the world itself. We will soon die and be forgotten, so we should remember how short our lives are and enjoy them while we can. But these realities of a fallen world need not engender despair because we also live in a world that is ruled by God, and it has meaning and purpose in reference to him. We should focus on keeping his commands and living to please him because we will soon stand before him for judgment.\nThe wisdom of Ecclesiastes is in coping with and even thriving in this life despite its brevity and apparent futility. Although we cannot comprehend all of God’s actions or the purpose of our lives, Ecclesiastes assures us that our sovereign God has a strong hand in all that happens, both positive and tragic. Those who trust God will take the apparent futility of life as an incentive to diligently and wisely achieve what they can while they are alive and to enjoy God’s good gifts in the process.",

    "content": "The Song of Songs is romantic poetry at its best. It portrays two passionate lovers who revel in the emotional and physical pleasures of human intimacy. The book was misunderstood in the past as being only an allegory of the relationship between God and the church, but is now accepted as celebrating the profound love between a man and a woman, providing a refreshingly realistic and wholesome treatment of human sexuality without being a how-to manual. The book never mentions God, but it bears witness that the Creator has graciously provided his human creatures with the good gifts of sexuality and intimate love.\nSetting\nAs a song of mutual human love, the Song of Songs is unique in the Bible. It is composed of the speeches of its characters, primarily an unnamed young man and an unnamed young woman. There is no narrator. Though the subject matter is not unique in the Old Testament, the intense and exclusive focus on it certainly is. Other ancient Near Eastern literature, primarily Egyptian, has similar songs of admiration and intense desire in which the lover’s physical attributes are extolled and direct invitations to enjoy them are given.\nThe Song of Songs is associated with Solomon, David’s son and the third king of Israel (see “Authorship” below; see also 1:1). Solomon is also mentioned in a few of the poems, both negatively and positively. The motivation of the author was apparently to celebrate God’s good gift of love and sexuality.\nAuthorship\nThe superscription (first line of text) calls the work, literally, “The Song of Songs of Solomon.” Many take this to mean that Solomon wrote the book in its entirety.\nOne difficulty with viewing Solomon as the only author is that some of the Hebrew words appear to be foreign loanwords from Aramaic and Persian, which would have presumably come from a later era than that of Solomon, when Persian culture was more widespread. However, it is possible that these words were in use during Solomon’s era. Solomon was the first truly cosmopolitan king of Israel, so it would not be surprising if he used foreign loanwords.\nAnother problem with accepting Solomon as the sole author is that he was not a good example of godly love—it was precisely his love for many foreign women that led him away from the Lord (1 Kgs 11:1-13). In fact, the only positive reference to Solomon in the Song is in Song 3:6-11; meanwhile, 8:11-12 presents him negatively and 1:5 is neutral. It is possible that Solomon did not compose the entire Song, but only part of it—especially if the Song is viewed as a poetic anthology. In this view, Solomon’s authorship of the Song might be similar to his authorship in the book of Proverbs and David’s authorship in the Psalms. On the other hand, Solomon might have written of himself in a self-deprecating tone.\nInterpreting the Song\nSerious study of the Song of Songs requires a humble, open spirit because of two very significant matters that are usually straightforward in other biblical books but are very obscure here: (1) It is difficult to find a story line in these eight chapters, and (2) if the Song is a story, it is not easy to identify the main characters and their relationships.\nEarly Interpretation (up to the 1800s).  The earliest surviving comments on the Song, provided by Rabbi Aqiba around AD 100, demonstrate Judaism’s ambivalence about the message of the Song. The rabbi famously stated: “Whoever sings the Song of Songs with a tremulous voice in a banquet hall and [so] treats it as a sort of ditty has no share in the world to come.” Some people clearly understood the Song’s imagery as sexual. Aqiba censured this interpretation of the Song, even damning those who held it. Aqiba declared, “All the ages are not worth the day on which the Song of Songs was given to Israel; for all the Writings are holy, but the Song of Songs is the Holy of Holies.” Aqiba thus indicated his understanding of the book as an allegory. The man and the woman are not seen as a real man and woman, but as representing God and Israel. Likewise, the Aramaic Targum (interpretive paraphrase) of the Song presents it as the story of God’s relationship with Israel from the Exodus to the future reign of the Messiah.\nThis allegorical view represents the predominant Jewish and Christian interpretation of the Song from Aqiba’s time through the mid-1800s. Early Christian interpreters, such as Origen (AD 185–253) and Jerome (AD 347–420), adopted the allegorical interpretation but identified the man as Jesus Christ and the woman as the individual Christian or the church as a whole. Although the details regarding the individual elements within the book varied greatly among Jewish and Christian interpreters, allegorical interpretation was determinative. The allegorical interpretation of the Song is found in Catholic writers as well as in the writings of the Reformers, including John Calvin, John Wesley, and the Westminster Assembly.\nRecent Interpretations (1800s to the present).  In the 1800s the allegorical interpretation began to lose followers. It became increasingly clear that the only reason to deny the Song’s obvious references to sexuality was the deep-seated but unbiblical idea that physical love and spiritual life are polar opposites. This idea came more from Greek philosophy than from the Bible itself. The Bible text itself never suggests that the images of the Song were intended as anything but sensual and romantic.\nFurthermore, archaeology recovered much from the ancient cultures of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Egypt produced love poetry similar to the Song that could only be understood as human love poetry.\nThere was thus a decisive shift from allegorical interpretation to an understanding of the Song as love poetry. Today it is generally agreed that the Song speaks God’s wisdom into this important area of our lives as human beings: It affirms and celebrates God’s good gift of love and sexuality in the context of marriage.\nThe Song as a Love Story.  Many scholars understand these poems as a drama telling a story, either about two lovers or about a woman and two men. If only a couple is present, the characters are usually understood to be King Solomon and a young woman, and the entire poem is their conversation with each other. If it is a triangle, there is a second man whom the woman loves. In this case, Solomon is trying to force the woman to leave her true lover and enter his harem, but she remains faithful and true to her lover.\nThe main drawbacks of the dramatic perspective are: (1) There is no narrator to guide the reading of the story, and (2) there are many different possible stories, and every interpreter seems to see a different story.\nThe Song as a Two-Character Drama.  Some interpreters understand the Song as a drama of King Solomon’s love affair with a woman. According to this view, the entire poem is a conversation between Solomon and the woman he loves more than all of the other queens and concubines in his harem.\nIf there was a favored woman in Solomon’s life, the Scriptures suggest that she was Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he married very early (1 Kgs 3:1; 7:8; 9:24; 11:1), not the working woman from the king’s flocks and vineyards who is pictured in the Song. Furthermore, this song of true love is not very credible if the woman was one of the scores of Solomon’s women who are mentioned in Song 6:8. In other words, if this romance between Solomon and the woman was of such deep sincerity, why did Solomon add hundreds of other women to his harem?\nThe Song as a Three-Character Drama.  Noting the difficulties with the two-character story line, several recent scholars have become convinced that the Song actually describes a three-character drama. This would suggest a more complicated plot: The woman actually loves a shepherd, not the king, but unfortunately she finds herself in Solomon’s harem as a concubine, probably because she is unable to pay a debt of one thousand pieces of silver, which she owes as caretaker of the king’s vineyards (8:11-12). She is unable to pay because her angry brothers have forced her to take care of vineyards other than her own (1:6). So even though she is in the very close and potentially intimate presence of the king in the city palace (1:12), her passionate thoughts are set intently on her love for a common shepherd in the countryside (1:7). This fervent affection drives her to escape with her true love into the country where they declare their mutual love to one another in marriage. Three separations of the couple are recounted in the song, and the agony of isolation from each other is just as intense as their ecstasy when together. After the woman escapes and lives with her shepherd husband, she is able to hire caretakers to harvest her crop and pay off the debt to Solomon. Now she and her beloved are forever free to continue living and loving together in the countryside (8:12-14).\nThe Song as an Anthology of Love Poetry.  Some scholars have concluded that approaching the Song as a drama imposes a story on the book that is not really there. These interpreters believe that the Song of Songs is an anthology of love poems that do not tell a story, but rather evoke a mood. The poems use imagery to express the poets’ understanding of human sexuality. In this way, the Song is similar to the book of Psalms, except that all the poems have to do with love between a man and a woman.\nFrom this perspective, the Song of Songs is composed of some twenty love poems that are bound together by consistency of characters, refrains, repeated images, and other poetic binding devices.\nThe main criticism of viewing the Song as merely a poetic anthology is that the Song exhibits a greater unity and development than is usual for such a collection. There is repetition and development of poetic themes, and there seems to be growth in the couple’s relationship. Those who view the Song as a story or drama would argue that the anthology view fails to take this into account. Even if the Song is not a story per se, it certainly seems to have a structure and coherence that transcends the individual stanzas of poetry. However, those who view it as an anthology rather than a story generally do take into account the unity and development in the Song. They view the Song like a concerto or symphony in which themes repeat and build without actually uncovering a narrative or plot.\nConclusion.  Each of these interpretive approaches has its challenges. The approach of the study notes here is (1) to point out different elements in the book that might contribute to a story line or to our understanding of its structure as an anthology and (2) to discuss the possible meaning of individual scenes and images.\nMarriage in the Song\nThe man and woman in the Song of Songs speak in the most romantic terms, describing sensuous longings and alluding to an intimate physical relationship. However, they are never explicitly described as married, leading some readers to suggest that the Song is an example of unmarried love in the Bible. Such a reading ignores obvious allusions to the true marriage relationship between the man and the woman. The language of some of the passages clearly indicates that the couple is married. For example, the man occasionally refers to the woman as his “bride” (e.g., 4:8-12).\nEven more importantly, viewing the couple as unmarried though sexually intimate does not take into account the context of the Song. In the context of ancient Israel, it is essentially unfathomable that this couple would not be married when engaged in such an intimate relationship. A study of Old Testament history (see Gen 39), law (see Exod 20:14), and wisdom literature (see Prov 5–7) makes it clear that sexual relations were only tolerated within the legal commitment of marriage. It would be quite strange for this book to be preserved alongside the other books of Jewish Scripture if it promoted sexual activity outside of marriage. Thus it is most natural to understand this couple as being married, at least in those passages where they are found in intimate embrace.\nMeaning and Message\nMany people have questioned whether the Song of Songs, with its overtly sensual imagery, belongs in Holy Scripture. But this poem is a wonderful celebration of one of God’s good and holy gifts. The Bible does not envision human beings as intangible souls temporarily encased in a body; rather, body and soul are interconnected aspects of a single entity. The body is important, and sexuality is sacred and good when enjoyed within marriage.\nHuman Intimacy.  Intense love and the appropriateness of voicing that love in words of physical attraction and fulfillment is the central theme of the Song. Yet it is clear that the lovers’ relationship is not merely physical. While their relationship certainly includes the sensual enjoyment of each other, it also includes friendship and a desire to be with each other for more than sexual reasons.\nAs human love poetry, the Song plays a crucial role in the Bible. Love and its physical expression are major aspects of the human experience, and God has spoken through the Song to encourage us and warn us about the power of sexuality in our lives. Here we have wonderful wisdom from God describing the beauty of a wholesome sexual relationship between a woman and a man. According to the Song, sexual intimacy in marriage should be mutual, exclusive, complete, and beautiful. The book encourages intimate, passionate love between a man and a woman who have committed themselves to each other.",

    "content": "Can God rescue us from the problems we face? Can he save us from oppressive world powers? Can he break the power of our sin and help us deal with its consequences? Isaiah answers these questions with a resounding yes! The prophet’s words sometimes overwhelm us with their beauty. At other times, his piercing words reveal our sin and drive us to our knees. Isaiah’s own ministry began with a vision of the love, greatness, and holiness of God. This vision—along with the entire book of Isaiah—convicts the human heart, motivating us to trust in our Creator alone for forgiveness, restoration, and purpose in life.\nSetting\nBy the time of King Uzziah’s death (740 BC), the southern kingdom of Judah faced a major crisis. The empire of Assyria, dormant for nearly fifty years, was now on the move again. The Assyrian army progressed southwestward from their homeland in what is now northern Iraq toward their ultimate destination, Egypt. The small nations of the Mediterranean coast, including Israel and Judah, stood in Assyria’s path. Assyria had taken Galilee and much of Israel’s territory east of the Jordan River. But they would be satisfied only with total control of Israel, Judah, and all the other smaller nations in the area.\nWhile Judah’s King Uzziah was still alive, Judah was able to ignore the crisis. Overall, Uzziah was a good and effective king, he had a strong army (2 Chr 26:11-15), and his people hoped that he could somehow save the nation from the Assyrians. When Uzziah died, however, ungodly rulers succeeded him. During this crisis of leadership, God gave Isaiah the vision that launched his ministry and guided him for the next forty years (Isa 6).\nAssyria, meanwhile, pushed steadily southward along the coast of the Mediterranean, conquering one small nation after another. During this time, Judah’s policy on Assyria oscillated between appeasement and confrontation. The prophet Isaiah brought a much-needed message: God is absolutely dependable, and it is utter folly to trust in anything or anyone other than God.\nUnfortunately, Isaiah’s central message was not always heeded. Around 734 BC, Israel formed a coalition with Syria to stand against Assyria. When King Ahaz of Judah refused to join this alliance, Israel and Syria attacked Judah in order to force Ahaz to join them. Faced with this crisis, Ahaz foolishly called the Assyrians to rescue him (2 Chr 28:16-21) rather than trusting God (Isa 7:1-12). Although the king of Assyria did defeat Syria and Israel, he also subjugated Judah and laid on it a heavy burden of taxation. Just a few years later (722 BC), Assyria defeated the kingdom of Israel again and sent most of its people into exile (2 Kgs 17:5-18).\nIn 701 BC, during King Hezekiah’s reign, Assyria again invaded Judah. This time, Judah relied on God’s faithfulness, and as promised, God rescued the nation from the Assyrian army (37:21-36).\nRegrettably, God’s people did not remain faithful to him. As a result, God eventually allowed Judah to be overcome by Assyria’s successor, Babylon (605–586 BC). What would Judah’s destruction and exile to Babylon mean in terms of God’s absolute reliability, which Isaiah had proclaimed? Isaiah answered this as well: God would indeed punish Judah’s wickedness. But he would also preserve a remnant that one day would return to the holy land. This return would not be due to any faithfulness on their part; it would be an act of God’s grace.\nUpon returning from exile (538 BC; see Ezra 1:1-4), the people were again tempted to wickedness, this time by the paganism that had taken root in their homeland during their absence. Isaiah showed that the gracious God who rescued them is also the holy God who demanded their obedience, righteousness, and exclusive devotion.\nSummary\nIsaiah 1–39 covers the period from the death of Uzziah (740 BC) to 701 BC. The introduction (chs 1–5) contrasts Judah’s present state of sin and injustice with the blessed existence in God’s presence that they had originally been called to. This comparison raises a question: How can the present corruption ever be transformed into glory, purity, and fruitfulness? The prophet answers in chapter 6, as he recounts his own renewal and calling as an example of how a change could take place nationwide. If Judah wanted to experience such renewal, however, it needed to turn from its sinful ways and learn to trust God. Throughout chapters 13–35 the prophet uses a variety of literary forms and life situations to confirm that God is the only truly trustworthy one; relying on any of the surrounding nations in place of God represents extreme foolishness. Isaiah brackets this message with two historical accounts of experiences with Assyria: King Ahaz’s experience in chapters 7–12, and King Hezekiah’s in chapters 36–39. When Ahaz failed to trust God, disaster resulted. By contrast, his son Hezekiah trusted God, and a great rescue occurred. Hezekiah, however, also had times of weakness (ch 39), setting the stage for Judah’s later defeat and exile by Babylon.\nIsaiah 40–55 addresses the questions that would arise during Judah’s exile to Babylon in 586 BC. Does the Exile mean that God was defeated, either by the Babylonians or by Judah’s sin? Has God’s purpose for Judah been frustrated, and is he helpless to do anything about it? In chapters 40–48, Isaiah shows that God is infinitely superior to any idol-god, and his people will be the proof of this when God rescues them out of Babylon’s ultimately helpless hands. In chapters 49–55, the prophet addresses the deeper question of Judah’s sin. Just as God rescued Judah from Babylon, he also intends to rescue a remnant of the people from the enslaving power of sin; he will accomplish this through the death of his servant.\nIsaiah 56–66 addresses Judah’s experience following the end of their exile in 539 BC. God had rescued a remnant from exile as promised; now they needed to be pure, righteous, and holy. God’s servants must not continue to walk in darkness and corruption, for those attitudes and actions had led to exile in the first place. As Isaiah speaks of rescue from sin, the light of God’s own holy and righteous character dawns in his people. As a result, all the nations that Israel once trusted in place of God will now come to Jerusalem to learn God’s ways from Israel.\nAuthorship\nThe book of Isaiah addresses three different historical situations, two of them beyond the prophet’s own lifetime. As a result, many scholars have argued that the prophet Isaiah could not have written the entire book; this view has prevailed since the mid-1800s. However, if God’s inspiration is a reality, predictive prophecy is a real possibility, so it presents no problem that parts of the book address what was in the future for Isaiah. Furthermore, the book displays a remarkable literary unity. When Jesus and the New Testament authors quote from the book of Isaiah, they consistently claim that they are referring to what the prophet Isaiah said (see, e.g., Matt 8:17; 12:17-21; Luke 3:4-6; Acts 8:28-35; Rom 10:16).\nDate of Writing\nIt seems likely from the historical references in chapters 6–39 that these materials were recorded at various times throughout the thirty-eight years between Uzziah’s death in 740 BC and Sennacherib’s retreat from Jerusalem in 701 BC. Because of the simpler, meditative, and reflective lyrical style of chapters 40–66, it seems probable that a period of time elapsed between 701 BC and the writing of these chapters. We do not know when Isaiah died, but tradition dates his death during the period of the sole reign of Manasseh (686–642 BC). It is thus possible that more than fifteen years elapsed between the writing of chapters 1–39 and the writing of chapters 40–66.\nLiterary Genres\nIsaiah contains a rich array of sub-genres:\njudgment speeches that warn Israel that God will punish them for their sins (9:8-21); \nprophecies of woe that lament the approaching death of the nation (5:8-30; 29:1-12; 31:1-9); \nparables that teach by analogy (5:1-8; 27:2-6); \ntrial speeches to prove a case (41:21-29); \nsalvation prophecies of hope for the future (2:1-5; 32:1-20; 60:1-22); \nhymns of praise to God for his faithfulness (12:1-6; 26:1-6); \nprophecies against foreign nations (15:1–16:14; 23:1-18); \nprophecies of a coming king, the Messiah (9:1-7; 11:1-9); \nservant songs about one who would suffer for the sins of others (42:1-9; 52:13–53:12); and \nnarratives of current events (36:1-22; 39:1-8).\nMeaning and Message\nThe book of Isaiah could be called the Bible in miniature. It has more overtones of the New Testament than any other Old Testament book. Isaiah gives us a picture of God as unique and transcendent (beyond our experience). Yet the holy and exalted God reveals himself and desires to be Immanuel (“God is with us,” 7:14). Therefore, the transcendent God is also immanent (nearby). God’s nearness prepares Isaiah’s readers to receive God incarnate (in the flesh), Jesus Christ, who is truly the Immanuel (see Matt 1:21-23).\nIsaiah tackles the foolishness of idolatry head on. He exposes the folly of trying to capture God in any created thing or trying to manipulate God to our own ends. The only way to receive the blessings God wants to pour out upon us is through our surrender and trust. However, the human spirit stubbornly opposes this. We would rather trust anything or anyone other than God, who is beyond our control. Those who stubbornly refuse to submit themselves to the true God and turn instead to false gods become estranged from God and face his judgment.\nThe prophet tells the story of God’s judgment on his sinful people through exile. However, God graciously returns to his people and declares that he will not cast them away altogether. Instead, he will purify and preserve a remnant that will glorify him among the nations and demonstrate that he alone is the true and living God.\nGod’s kingdom will be centered in a new Zion (new Jerusalem), populated by a new community of the faithful and ruled by God’s righteous servant, the Messiah. This kingdom will be built on the power of love rather than on the power of oppression and injustice. Only the righteous can belong to this new community. The same grace that rescues God’s people from the consequences of their sin also produces in them obedience to his will. As a result, they will glorify God and transform the world.",

    "content": "When God called Jeremiah to warn the kingdom of Judah of its impending destruction, the kingdom was relatively prosperous, free, and secure. But Judah’s fortunes dramatically changed as Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon asserted his power in the region. Judah suffered under his heavy hand for twenty years before he destroyed the city of Jerusalem and exiled its citizens to Babylon. Throughout these events, Jeremiah warned of judgment and destruction while distinctively recording his own experience of the pain and conflict these announcements brought. Jeremiah beautifully conveyed God’s passionate plea for his people to return to him and receive salvation, and he also proclaimed God’s promise to restore Israel.\nSetting\nDuring the decades before Jeremiah’s birth, Assyria dominated the ancient Near East, including Egypt for a time. King Manasseh of Judah became a vassal of Assyria, swore allegiance to Assyrian deities, and worshiped idols for most of his long reign (686–642 BC; see 2 Kgs 21:1-7). As a result, the kingdom of Judah became a spiritual wasteland (but see 2 Chr 33:10-17). Manasseh’s son Amon followed his father’s negative example during his brief reign (2 Kgs 21:21). When some of the palace servants in Jerusalem assassinated Amon (2 Kgs 21:23-24), the people quickly crowned Amon’s eight-year-old son, Josiah, as king of Judah.\nJosiah served the Lord, rejecting his forebears’ support of paganism. In the twelfth year of his reign, he decreed that pagan idols and altars should be destroyed (2 Chr 34:3-7). In his eighteenth year on the throne, he funded the repair of the Temple so that the priests and people of Judah could worship the one true God (2 Chr 34:8). During these repairs, the Book of the Law, which had been forgotten during Manasseh’s reign, was recovered. It clearly described Judah’s sins, and its teachings became a basis for Jeremiah’BC, soon after the Book of the Law was found.\nJosiah’s death in battle with the Egyptians in 609 BC (see 2 Kgs 23:29) spelled the end of revival in Judah and the beginning of the end of the nation. Between 612 and 605 BC, the Babylonians crushed the Assyrians and beat back the Egyptians; Judah’s security and prosperity ended as the Babylonians gained control of the region. Between 605 and 586 BC, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked, subjugated, and finally destroyed the kingdom of Judah and the city of Jerusalem.\nDuring this time, Judah’s kings remained apostate from the Lord and refused to heed Jeremiah’s warnings. Josiah’s son, King Jehoiakim (609–598 BC), renewed pagan worship in Judah and relied on the Egyptians for support against the Babylonians; he was violently antagonistic to Jeremiah’s messages. His son Jehoiachin reigned for only three months at the beginning of 597 BC. When the Babylonians defeated Judah in April 597 BC, they replaced Jehoiachin with his uncle Zedekiah (597–586 BC), who reigned as a vassal of Babylon.\nZedekiah is depicted as weak and indecisive. He respected Jeremiah and often asked him for advice, but he lacked the courage to follow the Lord. Instead, Zedekiah followed the advice of his administrators and broke his covenant of service to the Babylonian king. As a result, the Babylonians laid siege to Jerusalem in January 588 BC. In July 586 BC they finally broke through the walls of Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple, and razed the city. Many people in Jerusalem were taken captive to Babylon, though a remnant remained in Judah—including Jeremiah, who recorded what happened to the remnant community during the days following Jerusalem’s destruction.\nSummary\nChapter 1 (627 BC) tells how God chose Jeremiah as his messenger.\nChapters 2–20 (627–605 BC) establish the dynamic interactions between God, Jeremiah, and the people of Judah. Through Jeremiah, God severely criticized pagan worship in Judah, warned of invasion from the north, and pronounced severe punishment. In chapters 11–20, Jeremiah learns more about God’s purposes.\nChapters 21–29 (605–593 BC) focus on verbal battles that Jeremiah had with Judah’s kings, priests, and other prophets. Jeremiah’s messages include scathing criticisms of these vicious leaders.\nChapters 30–33 (596–588 BC) provide a bright spot as they emphasize the possibility of restoration for the people of Judah and envision a new covenant relationship between God and his people. The vision reaches into the future and announces a “righteous descendant” (33:15) who will bring salvation.\nChapters 34–45 (605–580 BC) tell of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, the breach of the city walls, and the complete destruction of the Temple, the city of Jerusalem, and the kingdom of Judah. Chapters 34–36 make it clear that the destruction was the result of Judah’s having broken its covenant with the Lord. Jeremiah then describes what occurred after the Babylonians left Judah (586–580 BC): Gedaliah the governor was assassinated, and the remaining people of Judah fled to Egypt despite Jeremiah’s warning not to.\nChapters 46–51 (605–593 BC) are an anthology of God’s judgments on Judah’s neighbors. Each of these nations, large and small, was to be punished for their idolatry and for their cruelty to God’s chosen people. A few nations were promised divine help in the future. Israel was promised deliverance from exile and restoration in the Promised Land.\nChapter 52 (586–561 BC) describes the last days of Jerusalem, essentially repeating 2 Kings 24:18–25:30.\nAuthorship and Date\nIn the fourth year of King Jehoiakim’s reign (605 BC), Jeremiah dictated a series of messages to Baruch, who wrote them on a scroll that was eventually delivered to the king (Jer 36:1-26). The king destroyed this scroll, but Jeremiah and Baruch rewrote the messages and “added much more!” (36:32). The contents of this second scroll probably make up chapters 2–20. Much of the rest of the book of Jeremiah appears to have been written later and added to the growing anthology. The book includes events down to Jeremiah’s arrival in Egypt, so it seems likely that the book was essentially complete by 580 BC.\nManuscripts\nTwo very different texts of Jeremiah have been preserved, representing two different collections of messages. The first, the Hebrew Masoretic Text, was preserved among the Babylonian exiles and underlies nearly all English translations of Jeremiah. The other text was preserved among the Egyptian refugees and became the basis of the Greek translation (the Septuagint), which was produced by Jewish scholars in Alexandria, Egypt about 250 BC. The Septuagint text is about 2,700 words shorter than the Hebrew Masoretic Text, and it rearranges some of the material.\nLiterary Features\nThe Messenger System.  The text of Jeremiah is dominated by a structure of communication called a “messenger system,” common in the royal governments of the ancient Near East and still in use today. The ruler of a country selected a person to deliver verbal and written messages to other countries. The messenger carried the authority of their ruler as they delivered the message. The recipient accepted or rejected the message and sent back a reply. If the recipient rejected the message, he might abuse the messenger and prepare for war (see 2 Sam 10:1-19). The messenger would report back to their ruler, who would decide how to respond.\nJudicial Framework.  Many of the messages in Jeremiah feature a judicial framework and vocabulary. The courtroom setting is established early in the book with the Lord’s statement, “I will bring my case against you. . . . I will even bring charges against your children’s children in the years to come” (Jer 2:9). The Lord assumes the roles of plaintiff, judge, and executioner. As plaintiff, he brings charges and evidence of sin against Judah. After the defendants express their arguments, the Lord pronounces the sentence as judge and then carries it out as executioner.\nNarratives.  Jeremiah contains historical narratives in which the prophet deals with kings, officials, priests, other prophets, and the common people in times of crisis. The book also includes many autobiographical narratives. Narrative sections often end with the pronouncement of a decree, usually in poetic form.\nMeaning and Message\nA battle raged in Old Testament Israel between pagan idol worship and worship of the Lord. Jeremiah repeatedly reminded the Israelites of their covenant with the Lord and that he required their true, heartfelt, and exclusive devotion. In a pivotal passage (Jer 10:1-16), Jeremiah clearly contrasts the foolishness of idolatry with the majesty, glory, purity, and power of the God of Israel.\nThe people of Jerusalem and Judah thus faced a major conflict. Jeremiah warned them that if they continued to worship pagan idols, they would lose their holy city and Temple, their loved ones, and their wealth and freedom. The people tried to escape their predicament through defiance, arrogance, alliances, and anger, but the events of war soon plunged them into utter despair and death. Even then, they seemed unable to choose another course of action. To cease believing in the magical power of idols and rituals and to give up the allure and excitement of pagan festivals and sexual freedom seemed too great a loss. The possibility that the Temple and Jerusalem might be destroyed was unthinkable. So only a few repented.\nWith passionate pleas, the Lord offered a way back to his gracious salvation. If the people would earnestly and completely remove the vicious and salacious practices of idolatry from their lives, submit to the Lord without reservation, and fulfill his ethical requirements, then the Lord would cease being angry and accept them as his people again. Even when the calamities of ruin, death, and exile became a reality, the Lord promised to preserve a remnant who would serve him. He promised to bring the captives back to their homeland and grant them peace and prosperity.\nThe brightest description of God’s mercy is found in chapters 30–33, which offer the promise of a new covenant and a new king. Instead of uprooting and tearing down, God would plant and rebuild (1:10; 31:28). However, only a few repented in Jeremiah’s days.\nIn all of this, the prophet Jeremiah experienced a deep tension between the Lord’s command (1:17-19) and his own desires. The Lord’s command was “Go . . . and tell,” whereas the prophet desired to keep peace with his neighbors (see 20:8-9). He felt a deep solidarity with his people, and the terrible words of judgment and destruction he was called to pronounce cut deeply into his own soul. More than any other Old Testament prophet, Jeremiah let us see his heart as he struggled to obey (15:16-18; cp. Matt 26:36-42).",

    "content": "Most of us have not experienced the death of our nation, and we know little of the agony of utter despair; but others in our world have experienced total devastation as their cities or nations have been destroyed by wars, earthquakes, tsunamis, or hurricanes. Reading the book of Lamentations can give us a point of entry into their experiences. It can help us to face the darkest aspects of human existence.\nSetting\nAfter a long siege, the Babylonian army breached Jerusalem’s defenses and took control. They deported many of the people of Judah to exile in Babylon, and they destroyed the city of Jerusalem, including the Temple of God. Only a few survivors remained in the land, including Jeremiah the prophet. Nothing else was left, and the hopes of God’s people were nearly dead.\nSummary\nThe book of Lamentations is a collection of five highly structured and emotionally powerful poems that lament Jerusalem’s destruction.\nChapter 1 describes Jerusalem’s ruins. Jerusalem is personified as a once-famous princess who is now a wounded slave, lamenting the contrast between her past and present with intense agony and shame. She acknowledges that she has earned her distress, and she prays that the Lord will relieve her miserable condition.\nChapter 2 summarizes the shameful situation in Jerusalem. The author agonizes as he watches starving children, weeping mothers, lying prophets, and mocking enemies. This tragedy happened because God withdrew his mercy and kept his promise to judge his people when they sinned against him.\nChapter 3 is an eyewitness account of God’s wrath. The author is sickened by the carnage; he is without hope and crushed by shame. Then he realizes that God’s anger will not last forever, and hope floods his soul. God’s faithfulness, love, kindness, and goodness are the ultimate, saving reality. Yet the hurt remains, and tears flow abundantly as he prays.\nChapter 4 is a gloomy description of the devastation before and after the walls of Jerusalem were breached, in contrast to the city’s years of glory. God was justly punishing the vicious sins of his people, and they could not escape his judgment.\nChapter 5 is a prayer that asks God to carefully consider the people’s plight. It ends with a plea for salvation, if salvation is still available.\nThe first four of these poems are acrostics based on the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, with each successive stanza beginning with the next letter (a feature that is lost in translation). Chapter 5 has twenty-two verses but is not an acrostic. In all five poems, pain and distress are paired with faith and hope. The suffering of the present seems more real than the possibility of redemption in the future, but God’s love and faithfulness remain.\nAuthorship\nThe book of Lamentations does not identify its author. The poems are situated in a context immediately before and after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Jeremiah was in Jerusalem during this time of calamity, and he has long been identified as the author. It may have been written with the help of Baruch, Jeremiah’s assistant and scribe. Second Chronicles indicates that Jeremiah also wrote laments at the time of King Josiah’s death (2 Chr 35:25). The author of Lamentations freely pours out his emotions, as does Jeremiah in the book that bears his name, and both books reflect on the future of the nation.\nThere are a number of other parallels between the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations. Compare the treatment of the following themes: troubled widows (1:1; 5:3; cp. Jer 15:8; 18:21); weeping people (1:2, 16; 2:18; 3:48-49; cp. Jer 4:8; 6:26; 9:1; 13:17; 14:17; 25:34); sin (1:5, 10, 18, 22; 3:42; 4:13-14; 5:7; cp. Jer 2:34; 4:17; 14:20; 30:14-16; 31:29; 51:51); punishment (2:2-22; 3:39; 5:14-16; cp. Jer 6:11, 25; 7:14; 16:2-4; 18:21; 51:30, 34; 52:14); false prophets (2:14; cp. Jer 23:25-29; 29:8-9); bitterness (3:19; cp. Jer 9:15); pits (3:53, 55; cp. Jer 37:16; 38:6-13); and clay pots (4:2; cp. Jer 19:11). Although some Old Testament scholars ascribe Lamentations to a much later author, such parallels support Jeremiah’s authorship.\nMeaning and Message\nWhat positive meaning can be gained from staring at fire-blackened stones or from walking among starving children and wailing mothers? How does one sort through the memories of false prophets who promised rescue from the Babylonian army encamped around Jerusalem? How does one make sense of the priests wandering the city searching for food, when those priests had previously conveyed confidence that the sacrifices they offered would provide victory and success? How can one believe in God’s goodness when corpses lie everywhere?\nThe author of Lamentations did find meaning in the calamity. God’s people had brought it on themselves through their false worship and immoral behavior. God was angry because of this rejection of his sovereignty and violation of their covenant with him. As a result, God had judged them, as he had promised to do (see Deut 28:32-53). God’s punishment was righteous and just (see Lam 1:18); he does not tolerate human rebellion.\nBut what about the future? Those who truly seek God have hope. In the midst of utter sorrow, those in anguish can plead before God and experience his mercy, forgiveness, and restoration. Misery threatens to overwhelm the soul, but hope brings light. God is eternal, and he is sovereign over the universe. Though doubts and fears continue to assault the human spirit, God remains dependable. God’s anger, which is just, is temporary. His anger ceases when confession and repentance begin, and it becomes possible to sing of God’s great faithfulness (Lam 3:21-26).",

    "content": "The prophet Ezekiel’s book contains strange visions, images, and messages that seem far removed from contemporary life. Yet its message remains very relevant: God will purify his people and live among them forever. Even during the darkest days, God insisted that he would restore his people. This message offered hope to the exiled people of Judah and provides inspiration to all who put their trust in him.\nSetting\nThe book of Ezekiel was written from Babylonia during the difficult days of Judah’s exile in Babylon (605–538 BC). The Babylonians had captured the Assyrian capital of Nineveh (612 BC), and Babylonian domination was made complete with the defeat of the last resisting Assyrians at the decisive battle of Carchemish (605 BC). In that same year, the Babylonians raided Judah and took hostages from the upper classes back to Babylon, including Daniel and his three friends (Dan 1:1-5).\nIn 601 BC, King Jehoiakim of Judah rebelled against the Babylonians, and he died during the ensuing siege (598 BC). His son, Jehoiachin, reigned for only a brief period before he surrendered and was taken to Babylon in 597 BC. At that time the Babylonians also took the prophet Ezekiel and other prominent people into exile and plundered many treasures from the Temple in Jerusalem.\nWhile Ezekiel was in Babylon, the Babylonians placed Jehoiachin’s uncle Zedekiah on the throne of Judah. When Zedekiah rebelled against Babylon, the Babylonians ravaged Judah and besieged Jerusalem in January 588 BC. The city was finally breached and destroyed in August 586 BC. The Babylonians forced Zedekiah to watch as they put his sons to death; then he was blinded and taken to Babylon with the other citizens of Judah who had skills useful to their overlords. These exiles remained in Babylon for a generation until the fortunes of the empire changed again (see the book of Ezra).\nEzekiel’s first visions took place in Babylon in 593 BC, when he was thirty years old (Ezek 1:1-2).\nSummary\nEzekiel’s visions span the years leading up to and following the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Before Jerusalem’s fall, Ezekiel delivered the woeful message that judgment would come upon the people of Judah. After that event, Ezekiel conveyed a new vision of hope: Israel would emerge from the ashes of her past. Although the prophet mourned what had been lost, he saw a bright future when the people would repent of the sins that brought their destruction and the Lord would establish the nation in holiness.\nChapters 1–3 tell of Ezekiel’s call and commissioning as a prophet. His opening vision tells of the Lord’s glory, ominously on the move (1:4-28). With images of motion and judgment, the vision depicts the Lord as the divine warrior in his heavenly chariot, coming to judge his people. During Ezekiel’s call (2:1–3:15), the Spirit told him that the stubborn and rebellious people of Judah would not listen to his message. However, the Lord wanted Ezekiel to be equally stubborn in faithfully delivering his message. Like a watchman (3:16-27), he should sound the alarm clearly and distinctly. God would hold the prophet accountable for delivering the message, not for the people’s response.\nIn chapters 4–24, Ezekiel delivers a litany of doom against Judah and Jerusalem. The prophet performs a series of sign acts depicting the coming siege and destruction of Jerusalem. Chapters 8–11 depict Jerusalem’s sins in four scenes of increasing abomination that clearly illustrate the reason for the coming destruction. God’s glory departs from the sanctuary, and the Temple is completely destroyed. The poems, oracles, and visions throughout this section cumulatively establish the inevitability and justice of Jerusalem’s destruction, culminating with the announcement of Nebuchadnezzar’s siege of Jerusalem and a final message of the certainty of judgment (ch 24).\nEzekiel then turns toward hope, beginning with seven messages (chs 25–32) that indict the surrounding nations for having assisted the Babylonians and for delighting in Jerusalem’s fall. These messages show that the promise God made to Abraham remained intact: “I will . . . curse those who treat you with contempt” (Gen 12:3). God’s judgment would come on all who took pleasure in the downfall of his people and who profited from their demise.\nChapters 33–48 complete the movement from judgment to hope, beginning with the decisive moment when the exiles finally hear the news of Jerusalem’s destruction (33:21). At this point the Lord again commissions the prophet Ezekiel to minister as a watchman, proclaiming judgment on those who refuse to repent and promising life for those who do. Messages of hope promise a new shepherd with a renewed covenant and land, where the people will dwell together in unity (chs 34–37). The dark clouds of war threaten this picture of blessing (chs 38–39), but the Lord demonstrates the certainty of the new state of affairs. The Lord gathers the forces of Gog and his allies, not to judge his peacefully settled people, but to smash their enemies once and for all.\nAfter God defeats Gog and his allies, he can reveal the final Temple and the reoriented land (chs 40–48). With architectural, ritual, and geographic imagery, Ezekiel’s final vision depicts the same message as the rest of the book: God will raise his people to a new level of holiness so that he can once again dwell in their midst. Those who were faithful in the past receive renewed access to God’s presence, while those who were less faithful remain on the margins. A river of life flows out from this new Temple; as it flows, it grows and transforms death into life. God’s final words to his people through Ezekiel do not warn of abandonment and destruction; rather, they promise fellowship and life.\nAuthorship and Date\nIn the opening verses of the book, the prophet Ezekiel claims that he is the author (1:3), and there is little reason to doubt his claim. The book shows all the interests expected from a priest such as Ezekiel, and the central event of Jerusalem’s destruction dominates the book’s structure. The prophet most likely wrote the book during the period in which his visions and messages were given (593–571 BC), with the completed composition probably dating shortly after the final message.\nMeaning and Message\nBefore 586 BC, both the exiles in Babylon and the people remaining in Judah were convinced that Jerusalem could not be destroyed. They believed that the presence of the Temple and its prescribed rituals would guarantee the city’s survival. Ezekiel had to tell them that they were completely wrong. Because the Temple and its rituals were corrupt and the hearts and lives of the people were thoroughly pagan, Jerusalem had to be destroyed.\nWhile all the Old Testament prophets condemned sin and idolatry, perhaps none used quite such sweeping terms as Ezekiel. From Israel’s time in Egypt onward, the disobedience of God’s people infected every branch of society and encompassed every form of offense against God. God could not ignore or condone such sin and would surely judge his people soon. Nothing could save God’s city or its people from his judgment.\nFollowing the destruction of Jerusalem, God’s people were in grave danger of disillusionment and despair. They felt spiritually dead, abandoned by God and cut off from his presence. They said, “Our sins are heavy upon us; we are wasting away! How can we survive?” (33:10). Babylonian deities, who seemed to have triumphed over the Lord, surrounded the people. No one had returned home from captivity. Their hopes were dashed, and they believed they had no choice but to settle in the pagan land of Babylon and become part of its culture.\nTo these disillusioned people, the prophet delivered a message of God’s sovereignty and glory, depicting God as majestic, transcendent, and powerful. The Babylonian gods had certainly not defeated the Lord; rather, God had voluntarily abandoned his land and dwelling place because of his people’s sin. Although he left the defiled city of Jerusalem, this glorious God did not abandon his people. Instead, he went to the remnant of his people in exile (11:16), where Ezekiel himself first saw the Lord’s glory (1:1). God was still controlling all things, even the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar’s attempts to consult his own gods through divination (21:21-23; cp. Dan 2–4). The Lord had decreed the destruction of Jerusalem for its sins; Nebuchadnezzar was simply acting as God’s agent.\nJerusalem’s destruction did not mark the end of the story for God’s people. God had promised to bless Abraham’s descendants, making them into a mighty nation and blessing all nations through them. The oracles against the nations surrounding Judah (Ezek 25–32) demonstrated that God had not forgotten his ancient promise that those who rejoiced at Israel’s downfall would themselves be severely judged. God would not forever abandon his people. One day he would return to be their shepherd (34:11); he would transform the land and the people from death to life. God’s glory would once again return to the Temple, which would never again be defiled. Further, God would gather his scattered people into his presence and replace the old ways of doing things with new laws and higher standards of holiness. When filled with God’s Spirit, the people would no longer defile the land with their sins.\nEzekiel points toward a greater hope fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Through Christ, God’s glory fully dwells in our midst as light in the darkness of our exile (11:16; 43:1-5; John 1:14). The Good Shepherd restores justice for his sheep (Ezek 34:1-24; John 10:11). He fills us with his Spirit and makes us new creatures in him (Ezek 36:26-28; 37:1-14; 2 Cor 5:17). Those who have allied themselves with Christ have even greater access to God’s presence than Ezekiel’s visions anticipated. They are able to approach the throne of grace freely and drink from the life-giving water that flows from the throne (Ezek 47:1-11; Rev 22:1-5). Everything that Ezekiel anticipated—and more—is ours in Christ.",

    "content": "While Daniel was coming of age, Babylon was flourishing. Meanwhile, the people of Israel were being exiled from Judah to Babylonia. Could God’s people hope to enjoy life as the Lord’s chosen nation again? Through Daniel’s experiences as a captive and as a government official, and through special messages, God revealed to Daniel his power and his plan for history, showing that he would rescue his people from exile and even from death.\nSetting\nIn 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (605–562 BC) attacked Jerusalem and took some Israelites as captives back to Babylon, including some of the young men of Judah’s royal family (1:1-4). In this historic event, God began sending his people into exile as he had warned he would do. The Israelites had broken faith with God by breaking his covenant (Deut 28:36, 64; Jer 11:1-17; 25:11-12; 29:10-11). Through the mighty king Nebuchadnezzar, God judged his people Israel (Jer 25:9). During that time, Daniel and his friends began a process of enculturation ordered by Nebuchadnezzar that threatened to absorb them into a pagan way of life while effectively neutralizing their identity as the Lord’s holy people (see Exod 19:5-6).\nMeanwhile, the Babylonians continued to devastate Judah and Jerusalem. In 597 BC, more Israelites were taken to Babylon, and in 586 BC, Jerusalem was destroyed. After 586 BC, Judah was no longer a nation; God’s people were totally helpless and hopeless. At this low point in their existence, God’s people became the tail of the nations, not their head (see Deut 28:13, 44). It seemed that they might simply be absorbed into Babylon and disappear from the stage of history.\nThe promise that Abraham’s descendants would be a blessing to all nations seemed hopelessly in default (Gen 12:1-3). The great Gentile superpowers of the ancient Near East, first Assyria and then Babylon, ruled the world. What would happen to Israel in exile? What would become of God’s promises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses (Exod 19–20), and David (2 Sam 7:1-29)? Would God act on the basis of his words of hope through his prophets? How would God rescue his people from exile?\nDaniel maintained his integrity, honored his people, and glorified his God through the reigns of several Babylonian kings to the end of the Babylonian Exile. As God’s people endured the “death of exile” (Ezek 37), God showed Daniel visions of the future, when a coming King would receive power and reign forever.\nIn 539 BC, Cyrus of Persia shook the world by invading Babylon, gaining entrance into the capital city, and subduing it and its blasphemous ruler, Belshazzar, just as the prophet Isaiah had predicted he would (Isa 44:26–45:7). Daniel witnessed the decree that the captive peoples could return to their homes (see Ezra 1:2-4). This fulfilled Jeremiah’s prophecy (Jer 25:11-12; 29:10-11) and answered Daniel’s prayer earlier that same year (Dan 9:1-19). After seventy years of servitude, God’s people were being restored.\nThe Lord gave his holy people encouragement for the future through Daniel by painting the canvas of history with visions and dreams. God spoke to give his people new hope as they faced a threatening future.\nSummary\nThe book of Daniel covers the period from 605 BC to around 535 BC. Chapters 1–6 feature events and stories that demonstrate God’s faithfulness to Daniel and his friends as they remained faithful to God and his law. Three times, the Hebrew captives were faced with royal decrees that went against God’s law (chs 1, 3, 6); all three times, they exhibited wisdom while obeying God, and he saved them from harm. Three times, God spoke through Daniel to interpret revelations he had given to pagan kings (chs 2, 4, 5). Daniel’s words and subsequent events showed that God wields ultimate power and authority on earth.\nIn chapters 7–12, the focus shifts to God’s sovereignty over the course of history. Chapter 7 uses animal symbolism to tell the same story found in chapter 2: World history will culminate in the establishment of God’s Kingdom, but first there will be fierce opposition to God and his purposes. Chapter 8 highlights the roles of Persia and Greece, culminating in the acts of a wicked ruler who opposes God’s people. Chapter 9 features Daniel’s marvelous prayer that is inspired by Jeremiah’s prophecy of seventy years of servitude (9:1-2). The prayer touched God’s heart and helped to end the Exile. As a result of the prayer, the angel Gabriel is sent to Daniel to reveal the coming seventy sets of seven, an overview of God’s plan to establish his people and deal with their oppressors. In chapters 10–12, the book concludes with a final vision that portrays history from the third year of Cyrus (536 BC), to the time of Greece and Rome, and on to the time of the resurrection. Daniel was faithful to his calling, and God promises that he will be raised in the end (12:13).\nAuthorship and Date\nScholars have endlessly debated the date at which the book of Daniel was put into its final form. Most conservative scholars argue that Daniel wrote the book in the late 500s BC. The book claims to be predictive prophecy (2:29-31; 4:24; 7:1–12:13), and the author places Daniel in the 500s (2:1; 5:1; 10:1). The book displays excellent knowledge of Babylonian history, although some historical issues do arise.\nOther scholars argue for dating the book around 164 BC, primarily because Daniel describes events down to about that time—the predictions in 11:1-35 are thought to be much too detailed about events that occurred between 190 and 164 BC to have been given 300 years beforehand.\nThere are problems with ruling out an early date for the book, however. Above all, the book in its present form is clearly attributed to Daniel alone; a late date assumes that Daniel could not have been the author. If Daniel himself did not write the predictive prophecies, then the book’s claims lack the integrity demanded of one of God’s inspired prophets and would have faced difficulty being accepted into the Hebrew canon. One of the major claims of Daniel is that God can predict the future (2:27-29; 10:21). Without denying that the precision of detail is remarkable, these predictions should not be assumed to be impossible: Who is to say with what detail God may reveal the future to his prophets?\nDaniel’s visions also have characteristics of apocalyptic literature. Apocalyptic literature was especially popular among Jewish writings of the intertestamental period (after 400 BC), so it has been said that the book could not have been written prior to that time. However, recent studies have argued that apocalyptic thinking is present in biblical books from the exilic period. Therefore it is possible to think of Daniel as serving as a model for the later apocalypses.\nIn summary, it is not implausible to view the book of Daniel as having been written in the 500s BC by Daniel himself. The arguments for later authorship are not without problems, and the traditional viewpoint is consistent with the book’s character as inspired predictive prophecy.\nDaniel as Literature\nDaniel contains history, but it contains much more. It teaches the theological lessons of history by going behind earthly events to demonstrate their true meaning and significance. It shows God’s hand and plan in history by the way it reports events.\nDaniel as Wisdom Literature.  Daniel is a book of wisdom intended to make God’s people wise in God’s ways. The wise person is purified through suffering, seeks the path of righteousness, and leads others into that way (11:33-35; 12:3). The wise person knows that God Most High is the God of gods, that he holds the future in his hands, and that he can rescue his people from any danger (3:16-18; 6:21-22; 12:1-3).\nDaniel as Apocalyptic Literature.  Certain parts of Daniel belong to a genre called apocalyptic literature (apocalyptic comes from the Greek word apokalupsis, meaning “revelation”). This genre pulls back the curtain of earthly history and reveals the activity of God, angels, and other spiritual powers behind the scenes. These activities affect historical events on the earth. Apocalyptic literature reveals reality by using rich symbolic language such that statues, animals, or horns can represent such things as kings, kingdoms, and persons.\nIt is important to interpret apocalyptic literature according to what its imagery intends. What is the reality and truth behind the imagery? The literary context and the historical background of a passage must be examined in order to properly interpret its symbolism. Sometimes the insights needed to interpret the imagery are found within the text (7:1-14, 16-17, 23-25). In other cases, a study of the social, political, military, or cultural milieu will yield helpful insights. For instance, studying the history of Babylon can be helpful in understanding why a certain image for Babylon (a golden head or a lion) is fitting. By going behind earthly events to demonstrate their true meaning, the book of Daniel teaches a number of theological lessons.\nThe Text of Daniel\nThe ancient Greek version of Daniel and the Latin Vulgate include three passages not found in the Hebrew manuscripts. These passages are included in Roman Catholic and Orthodox editions of the Bible, but not in Protestant editions.\nMeaning and Message\nDaniel’s major theme is that God is sovereign: He will accomplish his purposes for humanity and all of creation. History is on an inexorable march toward the Kingdom of God, in which God’s sovereignty will be fully realized. God judges and rescues his people, controls history as he pleases on a universal scale, and raises up or brings down pagan kingdoms and kings. He decided when to conclude the Exile (9:18-19), and he defeats and controls the powers of evil (4:30, 32; 7:8, 20-21; 10:13; 11:28, 30-32). Heavenly powers bow to him (3:28; 4:23, 35; 5:5; 6:21; 8:16; 9:21; 10:5, 13; 12:1), and he has the power to raise the dead (12:1-3). His wisdom controls all things (3:18; 11:35). He chooses and approves of those who are beloved and highly esteemed in his eyes (9:23; 10:11, 19). God establishes his Kingdom over all the earth forever, and his people will rule over it with their King, the Son of Man (7:13, 22; see Ps 110:1; Matt 24:27-44; 25:31; 26:2, 64; Mark 14:62; Rev 1:7).",

    "content": "Hosea experienced betrayal and anguish because of his wife’s adultery. Hosea’s experiences reflect God’s agony over his people’s sins. God’s justice requires judgment, but in his love, God promises to redeem his chosen people. Hosea opens a window for us into the very heart of God.\nSetting\nFew eras in ancient Israel were more turbulent than the mid-700s BC. Hosea began his ministry in the northern kingdom toward the end of the long and stable reign of Jeroboam II (793–753 BC). Despite being an evil king (2 Kgs 14:23-24), Jeroboam was a strong and capable leader who expanded the boundaries of Israel to an extent not seen since the glorious days of David and Solomon (2 Kgs 14:25-28). Jeroboam’s successes brought great wealth to some Israelites, but left many others poor and destitute.\nJeroboam II died early in Hosea’s ministry. During the following three decades, six different kings sat on Israel’s throne. Only one died a natural death; four were assassinated. In the midst of this political turmoil, hostile foreign powers were threatening to destroy the nation.\nThe northern kingdom, which had worshiped pagan gods from its inception, now turned even more forcefully to these foreign deities. The Israelites grasped at any straw that might save them from destruction, but they refused to turn to the Lord. Then in 722 BC, the relentless Assyrian empire destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel.\nHosea proclaimed God’s coming judgment to this frantic nation in its final days. But he also offered hope, imploring the Israelites to return to the Lord, who alone could restore them.\nSummary\nChapters 1–3 describe the prophet’s unhappy marriage to an unfaithful wife. The purpose of this section is not to present a biography but to illuminate God’s painful relationship with Israel, his chosen people. Just as Hosea’s wife, Gomer, was unfaithful, Israel acted like a prostitute by worshiping Canaanite gods. Hosea proclaimed God’s judgment, but he also announced God’s desire to reclaim his wayward bride and restore her relationship with him.\nChapters 4–14 contain a diverse collection of Hosea’s prophecies, presented in roughly chronological order from early in his ministry until just before the destruction of Israel in 722 BC. In these chapters, the prophet presents God’s charges against the people of Israel and especially against their leaders. The consequences for their sin would be severe—the nation would be destroyed. However, God would not give up his chosen people. The book concludes with a divine promise of future restoration.\nAuthorship and Date\nWe know nothing about the prophet Hosea apart from this book. We learn his father’s name (1:1), that he was married to a woman named Gomer, and that he had children with her.\nHosea prophesied to the northern kingdom of Israel from around 760 BC until just before the fall of Israel in 722 BC (see 1:1). Hosea would have memorized his oral prophecies, and eventually he or his followers would have written them down and gathered them into a single anthology. This work might have been done in the southern kingdom of Judah sometime after the fall of Israel in 722 BC.\nLiterary Characteristics\nHosea was well-educated in Israel’s literature, history, and faith. His prophecies rely on literary and rhetorical techniques—such as figurative language, proverbs, and folk sayings—that made God’s message more vivid and compelling to the Israelites.\nMeaning and Message\nGod’s covenant with Israel stands at the center of Hosea’s prophecy. When God entered into covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai, he offered the Israelites the incredible opportunity of living in intimate relationship with the Creator and sustainer of the universe. The covenant promised spiritual and material blessings to his people, while obligating them to live rightly before him. The Lord had faithfully kept his covenant with the Israelites and they had enjoyed his blessings, but they had chosen to rebel against him and disregard his plan and purpose.\nMarriage is a powerful and memorable symbol of the covenant relationship between the Lord and his people. As a loving husband, the Lord provided Israel with land, food, drink, clothing, and security. Yet like an adulterous spouse, Israel sought fulfillment through the idolatrous worship of the Canaanite gods. These deities became Israel’s lovers, and she attributed all of God’s blessings to them. The personal life of the prophet Hosea with his wife, Gomer, played out in miniature this same drama of a wife’s unfaithfulness and a husband’s anguish over his wayward bride.\nIsrael rejected her covenant with the Lord. In response, Hosea proclaimed God’s judgment. Yet even as the covenant was the foundation for divine judgment, it was also the basis for God’s mercy. God did not judge Israel simply to punish her; his desire was to redeem her. Divine judgment was intended to turn Israel back to her true husband, so that in his mercy, he might restore her and reestablish his covenant with her.\nHosea shows that God’s mercy is extended to Israel through judgment, not instead of judgment. God has done the same thing for us: Through the judgment at the cross of Christ, God extends an invitation of mercy to all.",

    "content": "When disaster strikes, we usually respond in one of two ways. We either turn to God and enter a renewed relationship with him shaped by a fuller understanding of his nature and character, or we turn away from God and blame him or others for our troubles. Some even deny God’s existence. The people of ancient Israel experienced disaster and were faced with this same decision. Would they turn away from God in their time of trouble or turn to him and seek his blessings?\nSetting\nJoel prophesied to the people of Judah and Jerusalem in the midst of a catastrophe that threatened their very existence. A locust plague of unprecedented proportions had struck the land. Millions of voracious insects arrived in wave after wave to consume every green plant—vegetable gardens, grain crops, grapevines, fruit trees, and even the grass upon which their sheep and goats grazed. In the face of such a disaster, all human and animal life was at risk. In the ancient world, there were no insecticides to kill the locusts, no stocks of nonperishable food for emergencies, and no relief agencies to bring in food supplies. Such a plague brought with it the specter of death for thousands upon thousands, especially the very young and the very old.\nDuring such a perilous time, it was only natural that the people of Judah and Jerusalem would ask hard questions about the justice and mercy of God. Is God truly in charge of heaven and earth? Is he good? They also looked inward at their own sin and moral responsibility for the plague. Has God sent the locust plague to punish us for our failure to live in right relationship with him? Will God be merciful to us? Do we have a future? In response to such questions, the prophet Joel delivered the word of the Lord to his people.\nSummary\nThe book of Joel consists of two nearly equal parts. In the first section (1:1–2:17), the prophet describes the devastating locust plague that afflicted Judah and Jerusalem. The plague was so severe that it laid waste to the entire land, destroying grains, vines, and trees. The effects of the plague were further compounded by a drought that left the land parched and burned. As a result, both humans and animals groaned with hunger, and the people had nothing left to bring to the Temple as an offering to the Lord. Therefore, in 2:12-17, Joel calls on the people to repent and throw themselves on the mercy of their compassionate God. (Other commentators have understood this passage as an apocalyptic description of the coming day of the Lord, using the language of a locust plague to describe an invading human army.)\nIn the second part of the book (2:18–3:21), the Lord promises to take pity on his people and restore their land following the locust plague. In 2:18-27, Joel describes how God will restore their material lives in the immediate future, replenishing their fields, orchards, vineyards, and flocks. In 2:28–3:21, Joel turns his attention to the more distant future when God will restore their spiritual lives. At that time, God will pour out his Spirit on all people who respond to him in faith. God will also render judgment on the peoples and nations that refuse to acknowledge his lordship.\nDate of Writing\nWe do not know when the prophet Joel lived and prophesied. Joel does not list the kings under whom he ministered (cp., e.g., Amos 1:1; Mic 1:1), nor does he provide any other clear historical information. For this reason, scholars have proposed many different dates for Joel.\nIn the Hebrew and English Bibles, Joel is placed between Hosea and Amos, who prophesied during the 700s BC. This has led some to propose that Joel was an early prophet who may have lived even before Amos and Hosea. Because the book makes no mention of a king and regards the priesthood favorably, these interpreters believe that Joel prophesied while Joash (835–796 BC) was still a child, when the kingdom was under the oversight of Jehoiada the priest (see Joel 2:17; see also 2 Kgs 12:1-21).\nOn the other hand, several considerations seem to point to a much later date for Joel. Joel never refers to the northern kingdom of Israel or to its capital city, Samaria, suggesting that the prophet lived after their destruction in 722 BC. Likewise, Joel never mentions Assyria or Babylon, Israel’s great enemies from the 700s to 500s BC, leading many to argue that these two empires were already long past for Joel. Because the monarchy ended with the Exile in 586 BC, many scholars locate Joel in the postexilic period, after the Jewish people began returning to their own land in 538 BC.\nFinally, there are numerous passages in which Joel could be seen as drawing upon or directly quoting the words and ideas of prophets such as Amos, Zephaniah, Obadiah, and Ezekiel. Although it is possible that Joel ministered before these prophets and that they were borrowing from him, it is also possible that Joel adapted the earlier prophetic words to speak God’s word to people who faced an entirely new situation.\nThese observations do not prove that Joel lived and prophesied after the Exile, but they are convincing enough that the majority of biblical scholars accept a postexilic date. Fortunately, knowing the exact time in history that Joel prophesied is less important in his case than it is for other prophets. Joel’s message concerns issues that are relevant to every age.\nMeaning and Message\nThroughout the book of Joel, we clearly see God’s sovereignty over all creation. He is Lord of both the natural world and human civilization. The locust plague was not merely a natural event; the army of insects came at God’s command (2:11). The Lord controls rain and drought, fertility and famine, blessing and destruction. All peoples, both Israelites and non-Israelites, are subject to his sovereign judgment, but divine sovereignty does not negate human responsibility.\nBecause human sin has so negatively affected the natural world, Joel calls the people of Judah and Jerusalem to repentance. Joel can offer the Israelites the opportunity to repent because he knows that God is merciful and compassionate. It is God’s nature to forgive those who repent rather than to judge them, to restore rather than to destroy. Quoting an ancient text (Exod 34:6-7), Joel extends God’s gracious invitation to the Israelites: “Return to the Lord your God, for he is merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love” (Joel 2:13).\nFor Joel, the proper way to express repentance was through the official Temple worship presided over by the priests. This may seem surprising because several other prophets denounce the official worship because of widespread corruption among the priests and leaders (see Isa 1:10-18; Amos 5:21-24), but Joel recognized the value in worship when it is performed with a sincere heart that is fully open to God (an attitude characteristic of postexilic prophets—see Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi). In worship, invisible eternal realities are represented by physical objects and actions. However, the prophet reminds the Israelites that religion is much more than outward display; true worship is founded on inward transformation (Joel 2:13). The solution to corrupt worship is not to abandon worship, but to worship God in spirit and in truth (see John 4:23-24).\nTo a people who faced disaster, Joel brought the message that their God was fully in control of the future. He assured them that on the day of the Lord, God would intervene in the world to judge the wicked and to establish peace and justice (Joel 1:15; 2:1). Then he will pour out his Spirit on people of every class, gender, and age, making it possible for his people to live in accord with his law. The wrongs that all too often dominate our fallen world will only be righted when God fully and finally comes into his creation (Joel 2:28–3:21; see Matt 16:27; Acts 2:16-40; Col 2:13-22; Rev 21–22).",

    "content": "“Prepare to meet your God,” Amos proclaimed to those who worshiped idols (4:12). Let there be “a mighty flood of justice,” Amos admonished the rich who oppressed the poor (5:24). What brought this shepherd from Tekoa to Bethel to pronounce such powerful judgments? Amos did not make his living as a professional prophet (7:14); the “roar” of God (1:2; 3:8) had moved him to make the journey. His message calls for righteousness—right worship that yields right social ethics. God’s people still need the prophet’s help to make that connection.\nSetting\nIn 931 BC, the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms: the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). The first king of the north, Jeroboam I, did not want his subjects to go to Jerusalem (in the south) to worship, so he established shrines at Dan and Bethel. Drawing on an earlier precedent (Exod 32), Jeroboam used images of young bulls to represent the Lord (1 Kgs 12:25-33). This move typified the northern kingdom’s rejection of God’s revelation in defining both their worship and their ethics. Paganized Israel became an abuser of the powerless.\nThe calf shrines that Jeroboam I established at Dan and Bethel (1 Kgs 12:29), together with the presence of the baals (local representations of the Canaanite storm-god), reduced the worship of Yahweh (the Lord) in the northern kingdom to a pagan religion like that of Israel’s neighbors. Often, the worship of Yahweh did continue, but it did so alongside the worship of local deities. The Israelites thought they would receive some desired benefit (such as rain or fertility) from worshiping these deities. When Elijah challenged the priests of Baal on Mount Carmel, it was because the people wanted to worship both Yahweh and Baal. However, Elijah left them without that alternative (1 Kgs 18:21, 24). The message of Amos was similar.\nWhen Amos arrived in Israel (shortly before 753 BC), the rich were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer. Around 801 BC, the Assyrians had captured Damascus but were forced to withdraw due to problems elsewhere. Egypt was also in decline during this time. In the resulting power vacuum, both Israel and Judah flourished, recovering some of the territory they had lost to Aram (2 Kgs 14:23-29; 15:1-7; 2 Chr 26:1-23). The two kingdoms increased in prosperity, but the greater prosperity merely increased the power of those who already had it. Those who had no power became even more oppressed.\nIn response to this situation, Amos traveled from Tekoa (in Judah) to the northern shrine at Bethel, where he called Israel to account for its apostasy and inhumanity.\nSummary\nAmos confronted Israel with the message that lip service is not enough in worship of the Lord. After a brief introduction (Amos 1:1-2), the first section of Amos (1:3–2:16) is a series of eight indictments. The prophet directs the first seven charges against surrounding nations, with the eighth against Israel itself. By first charging Israel’s enemies with war crimes and theological aberrations, Amos wins the sympathy and agreement of his hearers.\nBut then he says, “The people of Israel, too, have sinned.” What follows (3:1–5:17) is framed by three prophetic messages. The first (3:1-2) accuses Israel of abusing its privileged status as God’s chosen people. The second (4:1-3) is an indictment of Israel’s party crowd. The third (5:1-2) is a funeral song for the predicted death of the nation. Between the prophetic messages Amos includes rhetorical questions (3:3-6), metaphors from his life as a shepherd (3:8, 12), sarcastic irony (4:4-5), historical recitation (4:6-11), hymn fragments (4:13; 5:8-9), puns (5:5), pleas for repentance, and predictions of the doom that awaits the unrepentant.\nThe third section of Amos (5:18–6:14) contains two prophetic messages of woe: The first is a warning to those who proclaim the day of the Lord as a time when God will reestablish Israel as a leading nation (5:18-27); the second admonishes those who trust in their wealth, houses, or fortifications to save them (6:1-14).\nThe fourth section (7:1–9:10) contains five prophetic oracles based on visions. Amos first wins over his hearers with visions of two judgments that would be averted (7:1-6), but then drives home his message with two judgments that would not be turned aside (7:7-9; 8:1-3). These visions are interrupted by a brief biographical vignette (7:10-17). The final vision is of the complete destruction of Israel and its religious system (9:1-10).\nFinally, in 9:11-15, Amos promises better days to come, a time of healing and restoration when Jerusalem would be rebuilt, the dynasty of David would be reestablished in the land, and people would live in the peace of God’s Kingdom.\nDate and Location\nAmos’s ministry was brief, perhaps limited to a single year. Its setting was the royal shrine at Bethel in the northern kingdom (7:13), a short time before the death of Jeroboam II in 753 BC (1:1).\nRecipients\nAmos directed his message to all the Israelite people, but especially to the rich, powerful, and self-indulgent (see especially 5:18–6:8). While Amos clearly considered Israel’s split from Judah and the Jerusalem sanctuary as the primary cause of its moral and spiritual decline, he was aware that Judah was also slipping away from a pure worship of the Lord (2:4-5). Thus, the book includes condemnation of those “who lounge in luxury in Jerusalem,” as well as indictment of the smugly secure in Samaria (see 6:1).\nThe Prophet Amos\nAll that is known about the life of Amos comes from the book bearing his name. According to the superscription, he was a shepherd (noqed) from Tekoa (modern Teku’a), a small, fortified town about five miles south of Bethlehem in Judah.\nEarlier scholars often characterized the prophet Amos as a poor sheepherder who represented the marginalized classes in Judah and who was unjustly oppressed by wealthy landowners. More recent studies have taken a different direction, however. The Hebrew word commonly used for a shepherd is ro‘eh (as in Ps 23:1), not noqed. In its only occurrence as a noun outside the book of Amos, the word describes Mesha, king of Moab, as one who regularly delivered a substantial tribute of wool and sheep to Israel (2 Kgs 3:4). The term noqed therefore probably designates someone who owned sheep rather than a shepherd who worked for someone else. A second insight comes from 7:14. Here Amos uses a different word for shepherd (boqer; literally herder), perhaps indicating that he owned cattle, a sign of considerable wealth. Amos further describes himself as one who tends sycamore-fig trees (7:14), the fruit of which was used for animal fodder. The word that is used (boles) does not occur elsewhere, but in the context of a boqer, it may mean someone who raised sycamore-figs, rather than a worker who tended the orchards of others.\nThe emerging picture, then, is not one of a simple herder who tended the sheep and trees of others, but of an owner and manager of livestock and trees. This newer perspective on Amos harmonizes well with the contents of his prophecy. The book is written in excellent Judean Hebrew and shows a keen awareness of Israel’s heritage as well as its contemporary political and economic circumstances.\nMeaning and Message\nMoses had depicted God as ethical and as caring deeply for the powerless (see, e.g., Deut 24:10-22). But Israel’s apostasy and moral corruption permitted oppression of the poor and powerless. Material prosperity erroneously came to be seen as a sign of God’s favor, and the people prized appearances over substance. This violated God’s requirements for a holy people.\nProper worship of the true God leads to ethical behavior toward others. But corrupt worship and theology will corrupt human relationships. Theology yields morality, right worship yields good works, and faith yields practical change. Morality cannot be defined simply as personal purity or integrity; it also includes social obligations born of the conviction that all human life is God’s creation and bears his image (Gen 1:26-27). Service to God is expressed through service to his creatures.\nBecause this cry for humane treatment of the downtrodden applies to all people in every generation, Amos has inspired some great social reformers. For example, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used these denunciations and exhortations in his own preaching as a stimulus for the American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.",

    "content": "“Am I my brother’s keeper?” This ancient question, posed by Cain when the Lord inquired about his missing brother Abel, has become a metaphor for sidestepping responsibility. But Cain was in fact guilty of murdering his brother. Even to stand aloof when innocent people are violated is to share in the crime. Edom, a neighbor and relative of Judah, watched in delight and participated as Babylon destroyed Jerusalem. Now God would hold Edom accountable. God’s judgment always follows such injustice.\nSetting\nThe people of Edom were descended from Jacob’s brother, Esau (see Gen 25:30). The Edomites mostly inhabited the highlands east of the Arabah and south of the Dead Sea. Edom existed throughout most of Israel’s monarchy (around 1050–586 BC) and was often a vassal to the southern kingdom of Judah (2 Sam 8:14; 1 Kgs 11:14-16; 2 Kgs 8:20-22; cp. 2 Kgs 3:9-14). Edom was probably infiltrated and supplanted by Arab kingdoms around 600–400 BC. In postexilic and New Testament times, Edom resurfaced in southern Judah under the Greek name Idumea, whose most infamous citizen was Herod the Great, the self-styled “King of the Jews.”\nAs a nation, Edom replayed Esau’s original animosity toward Jacob. For example, Edom opposed Israel’s exodus from Egypt (Num 20:14-21; 21:4). Much later, when the kingdom of Judah was attacked and taken into exile by the Babylonians, Edom not only rejoiced in the event but also sided with the Babylonians against Israel, seeking to enrich themselves. This infidelity toward their “brother” Israel prompted Obadiah’s prophecy.\nSummary\nObadiah is built around two related themes: the destruction of Edom, and the vindication and restoration of Judah.\nIn Obadiah’s introduction (1:1-9), a messenger is sent to call the nations to battle against Edom, and Edom’s judgment is announced. The overthrow of Edom would completely destroy the pride of this nation that was secure in its physical location and its intellectual achievements.\nThe second section (1:10-14) gives the reasons for Edom’s humiliation in a series of taunts. The errant nation had a duty to its brother Jacob that it not only ignored but actively repudiated.\nIn the third and final section (1:15-21), Obadiah envisions a coming day of the Lord that will culminate in a universal Kingdom belonging to God. Those who do evil will suffer terrible consequences (1:15-16), and those who have suffered unjustly will be restored (1:17-21). The people of Jerusalem will repossess the land inherited from their forefathers and will spill over their borders in every direction. Their nemesis, Edom, will be subjugated as an example of what happens to those who oppose the Lord’s rule, and the whole world will recognize the Lord as King.\nAuthorship and Date\nObadiah’s name means “servant of the Lord.” He is known only from his prophecy and from clues that the text provides as to his time and place. Several individuals in Old Testament Israel were named Obadiah, including King Ahab’s palace supervisor at an earlier time (1 Kgs 18:3-16).\nObadiah’s prophecy was motivated by the invasion of the kingdom of Judah. In 586 BC, the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar terminated Judah’s independence and exiled its last king, Zedekiah (2 Kgs 25:1-30). Outside of the book of Obadiah, there is little reference to Edom’s specific response to this event (see also Isa 34:5-10). Obadiah probably wrote his prophecy shortly after Jerusalem was destroyed in 586 BC.\nLiterary Features\nObadiah’s message about Edom echoes that of other prophets, and parts of it closely follow Jeremiah 49:9, 14-16. It should probably be read in conjunction with other prophecies regarding Edom’s future and may even function as an expansion of such passages as Joel 3:19 and Amos 9:12.\nMeaning and Message\nOn first reading, it is easy to regard Obadiah’s prophecy as little more than a prophetic tirade in which the Lord’s wrath is directed toward Israel’s enemies. The Lord’s wrath is real, and evil does not go unpunished, but the book has far more to say than this.\nNations, like individuals, should attend carefully to what they plant, because the time of harvest will quickly come. God is offended by wrongdoing, and he brings justice for the oppressed. What Edom did to Judah, whether actively or passively, would rebound on them according to the ancient law of retribution (lex talionis): “As you have done . . . so it will be done to you” (1:15).\nThe day of the Lord will break in, bringing full justice to the oppressed, punishment to the oppressors, and the onset of a universal kingdom in which the Lord rules over all nations. On a local and historical level, this meant that Israel would be restored to her land and given sovereignty over the lands of Edom. On a universal level, Edom’s punishment was only part of a larger scenario of judgment. Not just Edom, but “all . . . nations” (1:16) will drink the cup of the Lord’s wrath. When the Lord returns as King to a restored Jerusalem, Mount Zion will be at the very center of the new order.\nThis picture of God dominates Obadiah’s theology and forces modern readers to face a decision. Whom will we serve—a god who is indifferent to evil, or the God of justice that we find in Obadiah? Only a God who judges evil can reassure us that evil will not ultimately triumph. Obadiah looks forward to that new day when “the Lord himself will be king” (1:21). This hope of Israel became the hope of the whole world when Christ announced, “The Kingdom of God is near” (Mark 1:15; Luke 10:9-12; 21:31-33).",

    "content": "The book of Jonah is well known for the amazing events it recounts, but the book’s main purpose is to teach us about God. Through Jonah’s experience, God, the all-powerful Creator, reveals that though he is a God who will pour out his wrath on the wicked, he is also one who eagerly pours out his mercy on those who repent—including those we would too quickly deem to be beyond mercy.\nSetting\nJonah was a prophet in the northern kingdom of Israel during the politically prosperous but spiritually dark reign of Jeroboam II (793–753 BC). Despite Jeroboam’s spiritual failures (see 2 Kgs 14:23-24), his territory continued to expand, as Jonah predicted (2 Kgs 14:25), approximately growing back to what it had been in the glory days of David and Solomon (see 1 Kgs 8:65). Nationalism was running high during the time of Jonah.\nAt that time, Nineveh was a key city in the Assyrian Empire. Assyria’s power had swelled in previous decades. Shalmaneser III of Assyria (858–824 BC) had extended the influence of the empire well into Palestine. Assyrian annals from that period record Shalmaneser confronting the Israelite king Ahab (1 Kgs 17:1–22:53), among others, at the famous battle of Qarqar (853 BC). But during the reigns of Jehoash (798–782 BC) and Jeroboam II (793–753 BC) in Israel, Assyria’s dominance in the region waned because of failed leadership and continued resistance on the frontiers. Jonah preached in Nineveh when the Assyrian Empire was at this low point, probably around 755 BC.\nSome years following Jonah’s visit to Nineveh, Assyria began reasserting itself throughout the Near East during the reign of Tiglath-pileser III (744–727 BC). In 722 BC, a few decades after Jonah, Assyria sacked Samaria and brought the northern kingdom of Israel to an end. A century later, the prophet Nahum of Judah announced the imminent destruction of Nineveh and the Assyrian Empire, a consequence of its pervasive wickedness. Nineveh was destroyed by the Babylonians in 612 BC. Evidently, the repentance brought about through Jonah’s preaching took no lasting root.\nSummary\nThe book of Jonah falls naturally into two parts. Chapters 1–2 recount Jonah’s initial rejection of the Lord’s commission to warn Nineveh of the judgment it had incurred because of its wickedness. Instead of heading for Nineveh, Jonah set out by ship in the opposite direction (1:3). But the Lord sent a raging storm to chasten the prophet. After a frantic attempt by the pagan sailors to appease whatever god had been offended, Jonah was “discovered” and was reluctantly cast overboard. God then demonstrated his power by calming the storm, and in a twist of irony, the pagan sailors worshiped God while his prophet presumably plunged to a shameful death. But God had plans to save Jonah. Jonah was swallowed by a “great fish,” within which he apparently repented (ch 2). After three days and nights, the fish spit Jonah out onto dry land.\nIn chapters 3–4, God reasserted his commission of the prophet to preach in Nineveh, and this time, Jonah obeyed. Nineveh repented en masse upon hearing Jonah’s warnings (ch 3), and God refrained from executing the judgment that Jonah had warned was coming (3:10). In another bit of irony, Jonah was unable to accept God’s outpouring of mercy toward Israel’s enemies. Jonah moved from anger to despair (ch 4). God once more deployed his power over nature to chasten Jonah, this time through the rapid growth and demise of a plant that shaded the pouting prophet from the sun. The book ends abruptly, leaving Jonah and the reader pondering God’s final question: Shouldn’t God (and his people) “feel sorry for such a great city” and desire sinners to receive mercy rather than wrath?\nAuthorship\nThe book of Jonah does not identify its author; the title derives from the name of the main character. Jonah or an associate of his may have written the book.\nGenre\nUnlike other prophetic books, Jonah is almost entirely narrative rather than a collection of prophetic messages. But is it historical narrative? Many have insisted that the book is fictional because it describes miraculous events, and diverse attempts have been made to classify the book according to some non-historical literary genre, such as parable or didactic story. Although the author of Jonah did utilize certain literary devices to make his point (the use of poetry, irony, and language common to parables), the book presents itself as a historical account (see 1:1), and it is best understood as a historical narrative with a theological message.\nMeaning and Message\nJonah is unique among the prophetic books. It narrates God’s sending of a prophet to Assyria, an enemy of Israel, and the widespread repentance that resulted. The lesson Jonah learned was one that the entire nation of Israel needed: “My salvation comes from the Lord alone” (2:9, literally salvation belongs to the Lord). Salvation is the Lord’s to give to whomever he pleases, and those who have received God’s mercy must not try to restrict the flow of God’s mercy to others, even their enemies (see ch 4).\nSalvation—whether from the threat of physical harm or from judgment—is thus directly related to God’s sovereignty. The sailors were saved after God calmed the storm. Jonah was saved from drowning when God sent the fish to swallow him. There is no domain, even in the depths of the ocean, from which God cannot deliver and protect human life. Likewise, there is no nation that God cannot judge (3:4, 9) or save from judgment (3:10; see Jer 18:7-10).\nThe book of Jonah affirms that, long before Christ came, God was eager to bring salvation beyond the borders of Israel. Israel was his covenant people, but from the beginning his desire was to bless the nations through Israel (see Gen 12:3). God’s heart for the nations is that they turn from idols to know him, the God of heaven who created the world (Jon 1:9; see 2 Pet 3:9).",

    "content": "God’s judgment was coming against false prophets, against Israel’s wayward leaders, and against the rich who oppressed the poor. God’s indictment against his people resulted in their ruin, but after ruin would come restoration. Through Micah, God’s Spirit provided a strong word of hope for Israel’s future. The Lord promised to rescue the remnant of Israel—they would return to their land as God’s renewed people. God promised to subdue their enemies and send his ruler from Bethlehem. Micah exclaims simply but powerfully that there is no God like the Lord.\nSetting\nMicah delivered his prophecies during the reigns of the southern kings Jotham (750–732 BC), Ahaz (743–715 BC), and Hezekiah (728–686 BC), all of whom had relatively long reigns. At that time, both Israel and Judah were characterized by moral and religious corruption, social oppression, political intrigue, economic injustice, personal vice, deception, and treachery.\nJotham was a moderately good king, but he did not remove the high places where illicit worship of idols competed with proper worship of God at the Temple in Jerusalem. Since the Lord was not entirely pleased with Jotham’s reign, he raised up King Rezin of Aram (whose capital was Damascus) and King Pekah of Israel to oppress Judah (2 Kgs 15:32-38).\nAhaz, Jotham’s son, followed the evil ways of the northern kings of Israel. He engaged in forbidden practices, including child sacrifice, pagan incense burning, and fertility worship (2 Kgs 16:1-4). When the Edomites and Philistines moved into the areas of southern Palestine conquered by Rezin and Pekah (2 Kgs 16:5-6; 2 Chr 28:18), Ahaz made an alliance with the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III (744–727 BC) by paying gold from the Temple and the royal treasuries as tribute money to the Assyrians (2 Kgs 16:7-9). Ahaz corrupted Judah’s worship by bringing pagan altars into Jerusalem (2 Kgs 16:10-13), and he inhibited worship of the Lord (2 Kgs 16:14-20).\nIn contrast to his father Ahaz, Hezekiah was a righteous king. He witnessed the fall of Samaria (722 BC) to the Assyrians under Shalmaneser V (726–722 BC) and Sargon II (721–705 BC). During his reign, in 701 BC, God delivered Jerusalem from destruction at the hands of King Sennacherib of Assyria (704–681 BC), but Sennacherib still devastated some forty-six cities in Israel and Judah (2 Kgs 18:1–19:37). God also healed Hezekiah from a serious disease. But then Hezekiah unwisely received envoys from the Babylonian king Merodach-baladan, who sought an alliance with Hezekiah against Assyria (2 Kgs 20:12-21).\nDuring the early years of this period, before the destruction of Samaria, the northern kings of Israel were Pekah (752–732 BC) and Hoshea (732–722 BC). Under both kings, Israel strayed further in the ways of Jereboam I, who had caused Israel to turn from God (2 Kgs 15:28). During Pekah’s reign, parts of northern Israel were taken into captivity (2 Kgs 15:29). Pekah was assassinated by Hoshea, who reigned until the fall of Samaria in 722 BC (2 Kgs 15:30-31; 17:6).\nAs Micah had warned, the northern kingdom of Israel was destroyed and its people were taken into exile. Hoshea had revolted against Assyria and had appealed to Egypt for help, but when Shalmaneser V heard of Hoshea’s treachery, he besieged Samaria, captured it, and destroyed it in 722 BC after a three-year siege. Hoshea was imprisoned, the Israelites were dispersed among Assyrian provinces and vassal kingdoms (2 Kgs 17:5-6), and people from various nations were brought into the devastated land of Israel to live (2 Kgs 17:24-41). Israel’s false worship led to its destruction and rejection by the Lord.\nSummary\nFollowing the superscription (1:1), each of three sections begins by calling Israel to “listen” (1:2–2:13; 3:1–5:15; 6:1–7:6). Judgment poured from the Lord through Micah’s prophecies against Samaria, Jerusalem, the wealthy, the corrupt, the false prophets, the oppressive leaders, and other nations. The people of Israel failed to follow God’s ways and did not respond to the messages he had given them. The Lord’s indictment was ironclad: Israel would be ruined and go into exile.\nMicah’s message of judgment is interspersed with words of hope, however (see 2:12-13; 4:1-8, 13; 5:2-15; 7:7-20). In the end, judgment would be replaced by the Lord’s grace, unfailing love, faithfulness, forgiveness, pardon, and compassion. Israel would be restored and renewed, and God would fulfill his promises to Abraham and Jacob.\nAuthorship and Date\nMicah was a native of Moresheth, a town about twenty-one miles (thirty-five kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem. Passages such as 4:6-8 and 7:8-20 suggest to some that a later editor completed the present form of the book in the early postexilic era (538–458 BC). This conclusion is not necessary, however. The prophet Micah is not the only preexilic prophet to prophesy a return (see Isa 52:4-12; Hos 11:10-11; Amos 9:11-15).\nMicah used figurative language to describe events, which makes it hard to determine the exact circumstances taking place when he prophesied and wrote. Some of Micah’s prophecies were probably given before the destruction of Samaria in 722 BC (see Mic 1:1, 6; 6:16). The Assyrian march into Israel and Judah in 701 BC is reflected in 1:10-15. Micah’s prediction concerning the fall of Jerusalem (3:12) was given during the reign of Hezekiah (728–686 BC) and is referred to much later by Jeremiah (Jer 26:16-19). Micah’s ministry thus seems to have coincided closely with that of Isaiah; the similarity of Isaiah 2:2-5 and Micah 4:1-4 supports this conclusion.\nMeaning and Message\nMicah’s message is clear: God’s plans for his people will prevail, and the nations will come to know God through his people Israel and his chosen ruler (5:2). The Lord’s faithful promises to Abraham and Jacob will be realized.\nMuch like Isaiah, Micah proclaimed that Israel’s hope would not be in escaping judgment, but it would be mediated to them through judgment. The people had become so corrupt that their only hope for an extended future was through the fires of judgment. That was a very hard concept for the people of Israel to grasp.\nGod’s goal is to have a special people of unparalleled moral and spiritual integrity and excellence. God will accept nothing less, but only his actions on behalf of his people can create righteousness in them (see 2 Pet 3:13). Many years after Micah, God would send a “ruler of Israel,” born in Bethlehem, to lead his flock and bring peace to his people (see Mic 5:2-5).",

    "content": "No one likes being in the path of imminent disaster, nor is the menacing threat of enemy invasion a pleasant thought. Can God protect in such circumstances? Will God judge wicked aggressors? Nahum’s reply is a clear yes. Nahum’s prophecy assures us that God still controls earth’s history. His messages are a warning to oppressors and a comfort to the oppressed.\nSetting\nIn Nahum’s time, the kingdom of Judah was in danger of being swallowed by a great superpower, the Assyrian empire. From Nineveh, the capital, the great king Ashurbanipal (668–626 BC) brought Assyrian might to its zenith. Its military power and cultural influence spanned the length and breadth of the ancient Near East. Even the age-old city of Thebes had felt the conqueror’s heel (3:8-10).\nThese circumstances were less than encouraging for Nahum and the people of Judah. Israel, their sister kingdom to the north, had already fallen to the Assyrians in 722 BC, and Judah now faced the same imperial enemy. To make matters worse, Ashurbanipal had recently captured Judah’s king, the wicked Manasseh (697–642 BC), and taken him to Babylon (2 Chr 33:10-11). Following his release from captivity, a repentant Manasseh (2 Chr 33:12-17) attempted to undo his former wickedness (2 Kgs 21:1-18; 2 Chr 33:1-9). Despite his efforts, his prior evil influence still permeated the land. A cloud of doom hung over God’s people. Thus, Nahum’s prophetic messages of Nineveh’s fall and of hope for Judah’s future were timely.\nThe seeds of Assyria’s fall were already being sown in Nahum’s day. After King Ashurbanipal repelled a strong coalition of enemies to the west and resisted his brother’s challenge to the throne, he busied himself with literary and artistic pursuits. Affairs of state languished, and Assyria grew increasingly weak. After Ashurbanipal’s death (626 BC), one after another of the great cities of Assyria began falling to foreign invaders. Then the unthinkable happened—Nineveh itself fell in 612 BC, as Nahum had predicted.\nSummary\nNahum opens his prophecy by depicting God’s power in two striking poetic passages, 1:2-6 and 1:7-11. These poems portray God’s sovereign judgment against wickedness and his goodness toward those who put their trust in him. The opening verses give assurance that God will administer his justice fairly.\nNahum then explains what God’s sovereign justice means in the flow of history (1:12-15). No nation is so great that it will not pay for its evil, and God is aware of the plight of those who are oppressed. The prophet assures the people of Judah that they will soon know changed circumstances. Peace and stability will return, and God’s people will be able to enjoy the uninterrupted worship of God.\nAfter predicting the siege of Nineveh and the return of normal conditions in Judah (2:1-2), Nahum describes the fall of the Assyrian capital in two vivid portrayals (2:3-10; 3:1-7). Between the two accounts, Nahum contemplates Nineveh’s destruction in a brief, taunting song. With biting satire, he declares God’s intention of bringing an end to proud Nineveh’s greed (2:11-13).\nNahum builds upon his second description of Nineveh’s fall through another satire of the city. Nineveh would be no more defensible than Egypt’s capital, Thebes (3:8-13), which Assyria had destroyed. Nahum closes his prophecy with yet another piece of satire (3:14-19). Sensing the hopelessness of Nineveh’s plight, he taunts the city’s citizens by urging them to call upon all their resources in order to defend themselves. Of course, that would do no good. Nineveh would lie fatally wounded with no one to help or even mourn her passing.\nAuthor\nBeyond the little that can be gleaned from his writings, nothing is known of Nahum, the author of this short prophecy. In the Hebrew text, he is identified as “Nahum the Elkoshite” (1:1). Elkosh could be his clan name, but more likely it was his hometown, which was probably located in southwest Judah. The details of the book show that he was well acquainted with the city of Nineveh.\nDate\nNahum mentions the fall of Thebes (663 BC; 3:10) and predicts the fall of Nineveh, which occurred in 612 BC. Therefore, Nahum spoke these prophecies sometime between 663 and 612 BC. Exactly when he did so within this span of years is debatable. It may have been sometime late in the reign of Manasseh (around 648–645 BC), perhaps during Manasseh’s attempted reforms after being released from Assyrian captivity (2 Chr 33:12-16). Or it may have been later, during the early or middle part of righteous King Josiah’s reign (640–609 BC).\nMeaning and Message\nNo empire, however great, is beyond God’s scrutiny. Sooner or later, all must give an account of their actions to the Lord. The reality of God’s righteous and sovereign justice lies beneath the predicted judgment of Nineveh and Assyria. He is in control of everyone and everything on earth, and he has concern for all who suffer, whether from the horrors and atrocities of war or from some other oppression. A burdened humankind can be confident that divine justice will ultimately prevail.\nGod is long-suffering (1:3), and his people must be patient. The assurance that this good and caring Lord (1:7) has a distinct purpose for his people (2:2) encourages them to a life of faith and trust. Beyond the book’s menacing tone lies the good news of hope (1:15). The prophet predicts a coming day when God’s people will once again worship him in wondrous peace and joy. They will at last be free from those who would take away their freedom.\nSubsequent writers of Scripture found in Nahum’s good news a promise of the good news of Christ (Rom 10:15; see also Isa 52:7), who provides the opportunity for deliverance from sin. Knowing that the unbeliever faces an even greater doom than that of fallen Nineveh motivates a missionary effort to carry the good news of salvation and eternal life through Christ to a dying world.",

    "content": "“Why do you allow injustice?” Habakkuk asked God. “Why do you tolerate evil?” God did not answer Habakkuk’s questions directly. Instead, much as he did with Job, God gave Habakkuk a vision of his deity. Whether or not the prophet understood God’s ways, he could safely trust him. Habakkuk’s questions echo in the hearts of all God-fearing people. The book of Habakkuk does not offer easy answers to the problem of evil in the world. Instead, it gives sound reasons to exercise faith in the sovereign, holy, and just God, who will ultimately bring justice to his world.\nSetting\nHabakkuk lived during a time when Judah had long been under the power of Assyria. The Assyrian Empire had engulfed most of the ancient Near East, from Mesopotamia to the Egyptian capital city of Thebes. But by Habakkuk’s day (late 600s BC), Assyria was showing signs of weakness that would ultimately spell its doom. After finishing military campaigns in the mid 640s BC, the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal became preoccupied with literary and artistic pursuits. His growing inattention to the administration of his empire brought weakness abroad and uprisings within.\nAt Ashurbanipal’s death, Assyria was faced with a new threat. In Babylon, King Nabopolassar (626–605 BC) proclaimed his independence from Assyria and laid the foundation for a Neo-Babylonian empire that would last for nearly a century (626–539 BC). Nabopolassar conquered one after another of Assyria’s principal cities. The capital city of Nineveh fell in 612 BC, and the remaining Assyrian forces were subsequently defeated at Haran (609 BC) and Carchemish (605 BC).\nWhen Nabopolassar’s son Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC) succeeded him, his empire extended over vast portions of the ancient Near East. Nebuchadnezzar launched a series of campaigns against the kingdom of Judah, successfully attacking Jerusalem on three occasions and carrying many of its people into slavery. The last of these attacks (586 BC) resulted in the final overthrow of the kingdom of Judah.\nExcept for the final years of the godly king Josiah (640–609 BC), violence and injustice characterized Judean society from the evil reign of Manasseh (697–642 BC) to the fall of Jerusalem (586 BC). In many ways Manasseh was the opposite of his godly father, Hezekiah (see 2 Kgs 21:1-9; 2 Chr 33:2-9). Manasseh actively promoted pagan rites that pre-Israelite settlers of Canaan had practiced. This apostasy doomed Judah. Manasseh’s later repentance and attempts to undo his earlier evils (2 Chr 33:15-19) did not result in lasting change, and his son Amon reintroduced the pagan practices (2 Kgs 21:21-22). The subsequent ministries of prophets such as Zephaniah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and the reform efforts of Josiah (2 Chr 34:1–35:19) also did not produce lasting change. Judah’s later kings were all condemned for their wickedness (2 Kgs 23:32, 37; 24:19; Jer 22; 27:1-22; 36:30-31). Even during Josiah’s reforms, the people of Judah remained entrenched in their apostasy.\nBoth externally and internally, the nation of Judah was in a precarious state. It was during this last, tragic period of Judah’s history as an independent state that Habakkuk lived and served as prophet (see Hab 1:2-4).\nSummary\nHabakkuk’s prophecy is a dialogue between God and the prophet. In the opening verses, Habakkuk contemplates the violent society Judah had become. He cannot understand why God seems to ignore Judah’s sin. Habakkuk feels that despite his repeated cries, God simply is not listening to him (1:2-4). God’s first answer is that he is about to deal with Judah’s violence by bringing an even more violent people, the Babylonians, to judge them (1:5-11).\nThis answer perplexes Habakkuk even more (1:12–2:1). Judah was indeed wicked, but why would God use people who were even more wicked to chastise his own people? God’s answer to this question focuses on his justice in punishing both Judah and the Babylonians (2:2-5). Both failed to maintain God’s standards of faith and morality, and both merited God’s judgment. In a series of five taunt songs (2:6-20), God lists his charges against all who are corrupt and do injustice. Undoubtedly, this included the Babylonians; even if God is using people to accomplish his purposes, those same people are still responsible for living according to God’s ethical standards. If they do not do so, they cannot escape punishment.\nThe final chapter opens with Habakkuk’s prayer for God’s mercy on Judah, even while he chastens them (3:1-2). Habakkuk then records a psalm of praise that reflects poetically on the account of God’s redemption of his people during the Exodus (3:3-15). Habakkuk closes with a declaration of commitment and a note of praise (3:16-19).\nAuthor\nNothing is known about Habakkuk except that he was a prophet of Judah. One manuscript of Bel and the Dragon, a story included at the end of the book of Daniel in the Greek translation of the Old Testament, identifies Habakkuk as a Levite. If accurate, this might help explain the musical notations in the third chapter (3:1, 3, 9, 13, 19), as the Temple music leaders were Levites (see 1 Chr 6:31-47; 25:1-31). Habakkuk’s rich use of figurative language and his careful compositional structure indicate his high literary sensitivity. His hatred of the immorality and social breakdown that sin causes also demonstrates his deep spiritual concern that God’s people live by God’s standards.\nDate\nThe date of Habakkuk’s prophecy is uncertain. The circumstances mentioned in the book fit best with a time late in Judah’s history, but before Judah’s exile to Babylon; therefore, the prophecy is most likely dated between around 645 BC (near the end of Manasseh’s reign) and 605 BC (Babylon’s first invasion of Judah). Habakkuk’s complaint about social injustice (Hab 1:2-4) and his attention to the Neo-Babylonian Empire (1:5-11; 2:6-20) also favor a date during this time frame.\nRegarding a more specific date, three general positions have been advanced. (1) Many date the book to the time of King Jehoiakim (609–598 BC), whose evil disposition and wicked actions (2 Kgs 24:1-3) brought both condemning prophecies (Jer 22:18-19; 26:3-6; 36:27-32) and the threat of Babylonian invasion (Jer 25). (2) Others argue for the early days of Josiah (640–609 BC), who, prior to the finding of the Book of the Law in 622 BC, dealt with rampant apostasy (2 Chr 34:1-7). (3) Still others defend the traditional Jewish view that Habakkuk lived during the time of the independent reign of Manasseh (686–642 BC), whose wickedness (2 Kgs 21:16-17) and reinstatement of Canaanite worship and pagan rites (2 Kgs 21:1-11; 2 Chr 33:1-9, 19-20) caused God’s pronouncement of Judah’s doom (2 Kgs 21:12-15).\nMeaning and Message\nWhen violence and corruption abound and evil appears to rule, the faithful may be tempted to wonder whether God really cares or is really in control. Habakkuk’s dialogue helps us to understand that God does not despise such questions when they are brought to him in prayer from an honest heart.\nHabakkuk’s prophecy reaffirms that God is in control of history and that his dealings are always just and right. Believers must be willing to accept God’s answers and delight in his will, even if it seems completely foreign to their own thinking. God does see and care deeply about what happens on earth. Although people may not perceive it, God’s sovereign hand is at work, and he will ultimately bring matters to a proper and just conclusion (Hab 2:2-3, 14).\nThe Babylonians worshiped the raw power that brought them prosperity. God’s charges against the Babylonians remind readers to worship God alone (cp. 1 Jn 5:21).\nGod’s message to Habakkuk also emphasizes that the believer’s holy life of faith and faithfulness must reproduce God’s ethical standards (Hab 1:12; 2:4). Those who trust and actively serve God will be able to rejoice in the Lord (3:18; Phil 4:4) and live triumphantly under any circumstances (Hab 2:20; 3:16-19; see also Rom 1:16-17; Gal 3:11; Heb 10:35-39).",

    "content": "“That terrible day of the Lord is near. . . . It will be . . . a day of ruin and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom” (Zeph 1:14-15). Zephaniah’s words send a chill through the soul. Will the day of the Lord spell the end to everything? Zephaniah’s prophecy portrays the coming judgment, but it also presents God’s promise that his faithful people will one day enjoy a world of everlasting righteousness and joy.\nSetting\nZephaniah lived in changing times. Toward the end of Assyrian king Ashurbanipal’s last military campaigns, King Amon apparently led Judah to participate in the widespread anti-Assyrian uprising that took place in many of the western countries of the Near East. Since Ashurbanipal moved swiftly to crush the rebellion, Judah’s leaders assassinated Amon (around 640 BC) and replaced him with his son Josiah.\nJosiah was only eight years old when he became king of Judah. He enjoyed a long reign (640–609 BC) as a righteous king. In the eighteenth year of his reign, while repairs were being made to the Temple, a scroll of the Book of the Law was found (2 Kgs 22:8; 2 Chr 34:14-15). After hearing the law read to him, Josiah led his people in renewal and reform, reinstating God-ordained religious observances (2 Kgs 23:1-25; 2 Chr 34:29–35:19).\nBefore this pivotal event, the kingdom of Judah largely followed the idolatrous practices of Manasseh and Amon. Judah’s people were so devoted to apostasy that it ultimately brought about their doom (2 Kgs 21:10-25; 2 Chr 33:17, 21-24).\nZephaniah prophesied early in Josiah’s reign, after the death of Amon and before the Book of the Law was rediscovered. The time was characterized by religious indifference, social injustice, and economic greed (Zeph 1:4-13; 3:1-4, 7). A true prophet of God was needed, and Zephaniah was such a man; he may have helped prepare people’s hearts for Josiah’s sweeping reforms.\nSummary\nZephaniah begins his prophecy by announcing the day of the Lord. This expression signified God’s coming judgment on the sinful world (1:2-3, 14-18), including his people in Judah and Jerusalem (1:4-13). Much like the people of Israel in the time of Amos some 125 years earlier, the people of Judah looked forward to “that day” as a time when God would vindicate them by destroying their enemies. Like Amos, however, Zephaniah had to tell his people that their covenant relationship with God did not make them immune to judgment. Because the day of the Lord would fall impartially on all wicked people, Zephaniah urged his fellow citizens to repent, to seek the Lord, and to live righteously in all humility (2:1-3). Perhaps then they might experience the Lord’s protection in the coming time of wrath.\nThe implications of Zephaniah’s prophecy are clear. The nations neighboring Judah would suffer terrible judgment because of their crimes against God’s people, their arrogant pride, and their defiance of the Lord (2:4-15). However, Judah would not escape the Lord’s chastening hand, because its spiritual and civil leaders had led society into total corruption despite knowing God’s standards. In addition, the people of Judah had not taken proper notice of God’s sovereign judgment on other nations for crimes like their own (3:1-7).\nThese impending judgments were a precursor to a coming time of judgment that would engulf all nations on earth (3:8). However, judgment would not be the end: The day of judgment would come so that a day of salvation could follow (3:9-20). God promised restoration and blessing for a remnant from Israel and for all people (3:9).\nZephaniah records God’s future plan to remove all proud and arrogant people from the earth; only those who “trust in the name of the Lord” will remain (3:12). God will gather his scattered people and restore them to their land, where they will live in righteousness and safety, worshiping the Lord (3:9-12). The “remnant of Israel” will enjoy the outpouring of God’s blessings and rejoice in him forever (3:13-19). The judgment and salvation announced in Zephaniah foreshadow God’s final act of bringing judgment and salvation at the return of Jesus Christ (see Rev 19:11–22:5).\nAuthor\nLittle is known of Zephaniah beyond the lineage in 1:1, which traces his ancestry to Hezekiah. Jewish and Christian expositors traditionally equate this Hezekiah with the king bearing that name (see 2 Kgs 18:1–20:20), which would mean that Zephaniah was of royal descent and probably a positive influence in the life of young King Josiah. The unusual attention to four generations of family lineage indicates at the very least that Zephaniah came from a distinguished family.\nZephaniah lived in Jerusalem and was aware of conditions there (Zeph 1:10-13). He was a man of keen spiritual sensitivity and moral perception who decried the apostasy and immorality of the people, especially those in positions of leadership (1:4-6, 9, 17; 3:1-4, 7, 11). He denounced the materialism and greed that exploited the poor (1:8, 10-13, 18). He was aware of current conditions in surrounding nations and announced God’s judgment on those nations for their sins (2:4-15). Above all, this prophet had a deep concern for the Lord’s reputation (1:6; 3:7) and for all who humbly trust in God (2:3; 3:9, 12-13).\nDate\nZephaniah himself recorded that his prophetic ministry was during the time of Josiah (640–609 BC; see 1:1). Several facts suggest that Zephaniah prophesied during the early days of Josiah’s reign, before the discovery of the Book of the Law and the reforms that followed. Zephaniah reported that religious practices in Judah were still plagued by Canaanite syncretistic rites such as those that characterized the era of Manasseh (1:4-5, 9). Many people failed to worship the Lord at all (1:6), leaders were enamored of wearing the clothing of foreign merchants (1:8) who had extensive business enterprises in Jerusalem (1:10-11), and Judah’s society was beset by socio-economic ills (1:12-13, 18) and political and religious corruption (3:1-4, 7, 11). Josiah’s reforms corrected much of this (around 622 BC; 2 Kgs 23:4-14). Therefore, a date for Zephaniah’s prophecy between 635 and 622 BC is likely.\nMeaning and Message\nLike his contemporaries Nahum and Habakkuk, Zephaniah presents God as the sovereign Lord of earth’s history. God, the judge of all (Zeph 1:2-3, 7, 14-18; 3:8), punishes the wickedness of people (1:8-9, 17; 3:7, 11) and nations (2:4-15; 3:6). This sovereign Judge has determined a time when he will intervene in the world’s history to subdue wickedness and bring in everlasting righteousness. That day (the day of the Lord) will include all nations (1:2-4; 2:4-15; 3:8). God will pour out his wrath in judgment against humanity’s sin and rebellion.\nZephaniah focuses on the basic problem of human pride (2:15), which engenders a spirit of inner wickedness (1:3-6, 17; 3:1, 4) and causes people to reason that God will not intervene in human affairs (1:12). They go on in their violence and deceit (1:9), and their greed oppresses those around them (1:10-11, 13, 18; 3:3). God may rescind the penalty that sinners deserve if they truly repent (2:1-3), but such spiritual virtues as righteousness, humility, faith, and truth are necessary (3:12-13). God will gather and purify a humble and faithful remnant (3:9-10), restore them to their land (3:20), and give them victory over their enemies (2:7, 9). Jerusalem will be a blissful place (3:11, 18) because God will save and bless his people (3:14-20).\nZephaniah’s message of personal accountability for sin is echoed in New Testament teachings (Rom 2:5-6; 2 Cor 5:10; Rev 6:17; 19:11-21). It remains true that God’s rich grace is available to those of humble heart (1 Pet 5:5-6) so that they may find forgiveness of sin (Eph 1:7) and the sure hope of everlasting life and blessedness (Titus 3:4-7; Rev 21:1–22:5).",

    "content": "The Temple still lay in ruins nearly twenty years after the Hebrews returned to the land of Judah from exile in Babylon. Yet the people of Judah themselves were living in comfortable homes. Surely God’s house deserved better! Haggai pointed out this discrepancy and successfully roused the people to rebuild the Lord’s Temple. Haggai gave Israel a renewed vision of how their efforts would serve God’s plan for his people.\nSetting\nIn 538 BC Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, issued a decree permitting conquered peoples who had been deported by the Babylonians to return to their homelands (see Ezra 1:1-11). The first emigrants to return to Jerusalem were led by Sheshbazzar, the first governor of the restored community (Ezra 1:5-11). In their enthusiasm, the returned exiles soon began to rebuild the altar and the Temple (Ezra 3:1-13), but local pagan residents threatened the Israelites and discouraged them from their God-given work (Ezra 4:4-24). The construction site lay neglected for nearly twenty years after their return.\nThe Hebrew people were gloomy during this period. Selfishness crippled community spirit, and apathy and disillusionment detracted from their worship. Only a small percentage of Hebrew exiles had actually returned to Judah, the city walls still lay in ruins, the Temple of God was a pile of rubble, and drought and blight ravaged the land. Judah languished as a Persian vassal state while the surrounding nations harassed the leadership in Jerusalem and thwarted their timid improvement efforts.\nWhen Haggai began preaching in 520 BC, a severe drought was affecting the land (Hag 1:11). God sent him to motivate the Israelites to rebuild God’s Temple and to encourage the spiritual renewal of the people of Jerusalem. In response, the people resumed the rebuilding (1:14), and the project was completed in March 515 BC (see Ezra 6:15).\nSummary\nEach of Haggai’s four messages highlights a different theological concern. The first sermon (ch 1) challenged the Judeans to stop giving their personal comfort first priority and to focus on restoring proper worship of God by rebuilding his Temple.\nThe second message (2:1-9) assured the community that God had not forgotten the promises of blessing and restoration made by the earlier prophets. The glory of the Lord would once again fill the Temple (2:7). These were not just empty words to bolster a beleaguered remnant, but the sure words of God’s promise to his chosen people.\nThe third message (2:10-19) has ritual purity as its dominant theme. Haggai reminded his audience that the instructions of the law of Moses were still operative. God expects his people to be holy, even as he is holy (see Lev 11:44-45).\nHaggai’s final and perhaps most important message (Hag 2:20-23) reestablished the prominence of King David’s descendants in Israel’s religious and political life. David’s dynasty was crucial to the restoration of the Hebrew people after the Babylonian Exile (see Jer 23:5; 33:15; Ezek 37:24). Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David; his commission to serve as the Lord’s “signet ring” marked the beginning of God’s restoration of Israel (Hag 2:23; cp. Jer 22:24) and pointed to Jesus Christ, a descendant of David (Matt 1:1) who would rule in righteousness forever.\nAuthorship\nThe book of Haggai is silent as to its authorship, but it is probable that Haggai wrote his own sermons (1:1, 3). The Bible records no biographic information about the prophet Haggai, but his ministry is attested by Ezra 6:14. Haggai probably wrote his book sometime between delivering his sermons (520 BC) and the completion of the Temple (515 BC), an event that the prophecy does not mention.\nDate\nHaggai delivered his messages between August and December of 520 BC, the second year of the rule of Darius I, king of Persia (see Hag 1:1, 15; 2:1, 10). Haggai’s ministry in postexilic Judea overlapped that of Zechariah, who began preaching in Jerusalem in November of that year (see Zech 1:1).\nLiterary Genre\nWhile not a magnum opus like the books of Isaiah or Jeremiah, Haggai does have literary character. Haggai especially uses rhetorical questions to emphasize his thesis in three of the four messages (see 1:4; 2:3, 19). He repeats words or phrases to set the tone for his sermons (e.g., the repeated “look at what’s happening,” 1:5, 7; 2:15), and he engages in wordplay on occasion (e.g., Hebrew khareb, “ruins” [1:4] and khoreb, “drought” [1:11]).\nHaggai’s written messages are presumably summaries of more lengthy sermons. The messages are oracles—authoritative messages inspired by God. Oracles often include formulaic expressions that use stock words and phrases. Several of these formulas occur in Haggai: the “date” formula (e.g., “the second year of King Darius’s reign,” 1:1; 2:1, 10, 20), the “message” formula (“the Lord gave/sent a message,” 1:1; 2:1, 10, 20), the “God-as-speaker” formula (“says the Lord,” 1:7, 13; 2:4), and the “covenant relationship” formula (“I am with you,” 2:4-5).\nMeaning and Message\nHaggai’s four brief sermons sounded a wake-up call to a community that was spiritually asleep. His message was to “get up and go to work” rebuilding the Lord’s Temple in Jerusalem.\nHaggai correlated the community’s lack of agricultural and economic success with their neglect of the Lord’s Temple. He rebuked the people for their disinterest in worshiping God and called them to repentance and spiritual renewal. When the people responded positively and began the work of rebuilding, Haggai encouraged them with the promise of God’s continuing presence and help.\nHaggai called the people of Jerusalem to authentic worship, trust in God’s word, personal holiness, and obedience to divinely appointed leadership. Haggai emphasizes the abiding presence of God’s Spirit (1:13-14; 2:4-5), a theme shared with his contemporary Zechariah (Zech 1:16; 8:23; see also Ezek 37:27-28).",

    "content": "The people of God who had returned to Judea from exile were being oppressed by neighboring nations. As a result, they were discouraged, and they let their Temple lie in ruins. Zechariah encouraged them with a vision of things to come. God continued to love Jerusalem and the land of Judah, and his unwavering plan was to live there again with his people and establish his rule over all the earth. Zechariah warned Israel not to repeat the sins that had led to exile, and he called those who wavered between God’s truth and human wisdom to return to God, obey the commands of God’s covenant, and practice justice in the land.\nSetting\nCyrus, king of Persia, issued a decree in 538 BC permitting conquered peoples who had been deported by the Babylonians to return to their homelands (see Ezra 1:1-11). The first Jewish emigrants to return to Jerusalem were led by Sheshbazzar, the first governor of the restored community (Ezra 1:5-11). During his administration, the returning Jews laid the foundation for a new Temple (538–536 BC; see Ezra 5:16), but soon abandoned the project. The construction site lay neglected for nearly two decades as the people experienced economic hardship, political oppression and harassment, and spiritual barrenness (see Hag 1–2).\nIn response to their distress, God raised up two prophets to initiate the physical rebuilding and spiritual renewal of Jerusalem. The prophet Haggai, who preached for only four months in late 520 BC, challenged the Hebrew community to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple. The people responded favorably to Haggai’s message and began to reconstruct the Lord’s Temple that year (Hag 1:12-15). The prophet Zechariah complemented Haggai’s message by calling for the spiritual renewal of God’s people (1:3-6; 7:8-14). Zechariah’s ministry in Jerusalem lasted for at least two years. The rebuilding of the Temple was completed in March 515 BC during the reign of Persian king Darius I (Ezra 5:2; 6:13-18).\nSummary\nZechariah’s task was to prepare the people for proper worship in the Temple once the building project was completed. He did so by rebuking, exhorting, and encouraging them.\nThe people of Judah were committing blatant social and moral sins; they were passively rebellious and spiritually apathetic. Zechariah called the people to return to God through genuine repentance (Zech 1:3-5). Only spiritual renewal could foster true worship and meaningful service in the Temple, which was under construction. Only obedience to the Lord would usher in the long-awaited blessing, prosperity, and righteousness of the messianic age (6:9-15; 8:13).\nGod’s plan to do good to Jerusalem was contingent upon the community’s adherence to God’s laws, especially those governing their treatment of one another (7:8-12; 8:14-17). Before the other nations would seek the Lord in Jerusalem, Israel had to seek God’s favor, act justly, and show kindness and mercy to widows, orphans, and foreigners (7:9-10; 14:16-21).\nAuthorship\nThe book of Zechariah is silent about its authorship, but Zechariah probably wrote down his own sermons. The superscription (1:1) identifies Zechariah as the son of Berekiah and the grandson of Iddo, as Ezra confirms (Ezra 5:1; 6:14). Nehemiah informs us that Iddo returned to Jerusalem from exile in Babylon with Zerubbabel and Jeshua (Neh 12:4). Nehemiah also lists Zechariah as the head of the family of priests descended from Iddo (Neh 12:1, 16). This suggests that Zechariah was both a priest and prophet in Jerusalem.\nDate\nZechariah’s ministry began just two months after Haggai’s, in 520 BC. Zechariah’s last dated message was delivered in 518 BC. The first portion of the book (chs 1–8) was probably written down between 520 and 515 BC, since Zechariah makes no reference to the completion and dedication of the Jerusalem Temple in 515 BC (see Ezra 6:13-22). Zechariah’s undated messages (chs 9–14) might indicate that his ministry continued well beyond the completion of the Temple and that he composed these chapters later in his life, perhaps as late as 500–470 BC.\nSome biblical scholars assign chapters 9–11 to a “Second Zechariah” and chapters 12–14 to a “Third Zechariah.” However, the vocabulary and grammar show remarkable literary continuity throughout the entire book, and archaeological discoveries and socio-political considerations support a unified composition.\nRecipients\nZechariah’s messages were intended for the people living in and around Jerusalem after their return from exile (1:3). Within Zechariah’s sermons and visions are words specifically addressed to the governor Zerubbabel, the high priest Jeshua, and the rest of the priests (see 3:8-9; 4:6-7; 7:4-7).\nLiterary Genre\nZechariah is prophetic literature containing messages that call God’s people to repentance, to renewed corporate worship, and to the practice of social justice.\nIn addition, Zechariah contains elements of apocalyptic literature. This genre of writing interprets current events and predicts future events by means of symbolic language, ciphers, and codes. Such writing is often cast in the form of visions that are explained by an angelic mediator (see 1:9). The settings, characters, and events of apocalyptic literature tend to go beyond ordinary reality. Apocalyptic literature announces an end to the status quo and opens up alternative possibilities as a result of God’s impending intervention in human affairs.\nLater Jewish apocalyptic literature placed heavy emphasis on the future restoration of Israel in the day of the Lord. Zechariah’s prophecy was more concerned with social justice in the present. Three types of messages are usually associated with apocalyptic literature in the Bible: (1) encouragement for the oppressed, (2) warnings to the oppressor, and (3) calls to faith for those wavering between God’s truth and human wisdom.\nMeaning and Message\nThe book of Zechariah calls for repentance, spiritual renewal, and a return to right relationship with God (1:1-6). Zechariah’s duty was to comfort and strengthen a small, discouraged remnant of God’s people (1:13; 8:6-15). Zechariah also reinforced Haggai’s summons to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple (8:9, 13).\nZechariah’s messages came to him as visions of the future that promised peace to Israel, judgment of the nations, restoration of Jerusalem, responsible government by God’s appointed leadership, and righteousness among God’s people (1:7–6:15). Zechariah emphasized that social justice was Israel’s right response to God (7:8-12; 8:14-17).\nZechariah’s last two messages instill hope in God by focusing on the future restoration of Israel (chs 9–14). The prophet forecasts the Lord’s return to his Temple (9:8-10), Israel’s rescue from her enemies (12:1-14), and the establishment of God’s Kingdom in Jerusalem (14:9-11). Zechariah also points to the Messiah, who would be a suffering shepherd (13:7) and a righteous king (9:9), bringing salvation to Israel and peace to the nations (9:10, 16).",

    "content": "Malachi had a multifaceted ministry. As a sensitive pastor, Malachi offered God’s love to a disheartened people. As a wise theologian, he instructed the people of Judah in basic doctrine that emphasized God’s nature. As a stern prophet, Malachi rebuked corrupt priests and warned of God’s judgment. As a spiritual mentor, he called his people to more sincere worship and challenged them to live by the ethical standards of God’s covenant. Malachi conveys God’s simple but vital word to Israel: “I have always loved you” (1:2).\nSetting\nMalachi wrote to Jews in the Persian province of Judea, probably during the reign of King Darius I of Persia (521–486 BC). Jewish exiles returning from Babylon had recently resettled in Judah, joining others who had not been deported.\nAt the time when Malachi preached, the Temple had been rebuilt, but it paled in comparison to Solomon’s Temple. The priests and the Levites were the power brokers of Judah, yet worship at the Temple was in a sorry state. The apathetic priests actually led people into sin, not out of it. Worshipers offered inferior animals as sacrifices and neglected God’s requirements for tithes and offerings. The hopes raised by Haggai and Zechariah for a revival of David’s dynasty through Zerubbabel seemed to have disappeared.\nMalachi confronted a people given to religious cynicism, political skepticism, and spiritual disillusionment. They expected prosperity (Hag 2:7, 18-19), a king from David’s line (Ezek 34:13, 23-24), and the new covenant promised through Jeremiah (Jer 31:23, 31-34), but they saw none of these things. In the minds of many, God had failed his people.\nSummary\nMalachi presents a brief theology of God intended to correct the wrong thinking of the people of Judah about their covenant relationship with the Lord. Malachi introduces his thesis—that God loves Israel (1:2)—in his first message (1:2-5). The prophet then debates this thesis with his audience in the five messages that follow. The second message (1:6–2:9), aimed specifically at the priests and Levites serving in the second Temple, affirms that God is the Lord and Father of all Israel and deserves true worship. The third message (2:10-16) extends the implications of God’s love to human relationships, especially marriage. The fourth message (2:17–3:5) highlights God’s justice, appeals for honesty in speech and in business, and seeks genuine social concern. The fifth message (3:6-12) emphasizes God’s faithfulness to his word and calls Israel to a similar faithfulness in worship, especially in the giving of tithes and offerings. The final message (3:13–4:3) reiterates God’s desire for Israel to be honest and faithful in worship, in view of the coming day of the Lord.\nMalachi’s pastoral heart is evident in his preaching: He begins and ends with a message of encouragement (1:2; 4:2).\nAuthorship\nThe book of Malachi is silent about its authorship, but it is assumed that the prophet Malachi wrote down his own sermons because of the statement in 1:1 (“the message that the Lord gave . . . through the prophet Malachithe message that the Lord gave . . . through the prophet Malachi”). We know nothing of Malachi outside of this book; even there, the only biographical information given is that he was a prophet (1:1).\nDate\nUnlike many other prophetic books, Malachi contains no date formula that links the prophet’s message to the reign of any particular king (e.g., Zeph 1:1; Hag 1:1; Zech 1:1). Malachi’s language is similar to that of Haggai and Zechariah, and it seems likely that Malachi was a slightly later contemporary of these two prophets. It is possible (though not certain) that the battle between the Persians and the Greeks at Marathon (about 490 BC) prompted Malachi’s message—the prophet may have interpreted the titanic struggle between East and West as a partial fulfillment of Haggai’s prediction that God was about “to shake the heavens and the earth” and “overthrow royal thrones” (Hag 2:21-22). It is also possible that Malachi wrote later in the 400s BC.\nLiterary Genre\nThe literary form of Malachi’s prophecies is similar to legal procedures (or trial speeches) and disputations. A disputation pits the speaker against his audience in combative dialogue. In Malachi, the disputation typically features (1) a declared truth claim by the prophet, (2) a rebuttal by the audience phrased as a question, (3) the prophet’s answer to the audience’s rebuttal by restatement of his initial premise, and (4) the presentation of additional supporting evidence. The desired outcome in a covenant lawsuit and in disputation is to leave the opponent speechless by removing all grounds for argument. This rhetorical question-and-argument format gave rise to the dialogue method of exposition peculiar to the later rabbinic schools of Judaism (see also the teaching method of Jesus in Matt 5:21-22, 27-28: “You have heard. . . . But I say, . . .”).\nMeaning and Message\nMalachi seeks to motivate people to conform to God’s plan. Malachi’s preaching has an overarching concern with the covenant that established a relationship between God and Israel, with its attendant obligations and responsibilities.\nThree of Malachi’s messages deal with right relationships. The prophet’s premise is that right knowledge is essential to maintaining right relationships. He addresses right relationships in marriage by decrying divorce and encouraging marital loyalty. He also addresses right relationships in the community at large by focusing on honesty and integrity in the light of God’s character.\nMalachi calls God’s people back to a right understanding of God as Israel’s Father, Master, and covenant God. Malachi urges a return to right worship through participating in the Temple sacrifices with integrity. Malachi also encourages appropriate giving to God, who is gracious and generous in his response to those who are faithful.",

    "content": "Matthew demonstrates that Jesus of Nazareth is the long-awaited Messiah, the king of Israel, who fulfills the Old Testament promises yet turns the expectation of his contemporaries on its head. The Gospel of Matthew shows how both Jewish and non-Jewish people fit together in God’s unfolding Kingdom. It challenges the reader to live with total commitment to Jesus Christ as king.\nSetting\nMatthew wrote his Gospel when the early Christian community was at a crossroads. Would it remain a sect of Judaism or separate itself from Judaism and become a separate faith? Matthew’s Gospel derives from a Christian community near Jerusalem, surrounded by Jews who had not left their Jewish faith. This community, unlike the Christians of Paul’s churches, had to answer socially to the stipulations of Jewish law on a daily basis.\nThe Christians reading Matthew’s Gospel were challenged to live as Jewish Christians among Jews who were fully committed to the Torah. The letter from James similarly evokes a Christianity that is still firmly attached to the synagogue (see Jas 2:1-26). Here is a Jewish Christianity that remains as firm in its commitment to the Jewish community as to its glorious Lord (cp. Acts 15:1-41).\nMatthew’s Gospel tells how the life of Jesus affected Jewish Christians who were struggling with ritual, legal, social, and political concerns. For those early Christians, Matthew answered the pressing question, “How are we to follow Jesus in our day, surrounded as we are by Judaism, while seeking to declare the Good News of the Kingdom to all?”\nSummary\nMatthew’s story follows Jesus from before his birth until after his death and resurrection. Jesus experiences a series of potential dangers as a child (ch 2). As an adult, he embarks on a very short career, proclaiming God’s righteousness (chs 5–7) and performing astounding miracles (8:1–9:34); he broadens his reach by sending out twelve apostles (9:35–11:1). Most of Jesus’ experience, however, is utter rejection at the hands of Galilean and Judean Jews (chs 11–17). He confronts the Jewish leaders in the Temple during his last week (chs 21–22), announces a final series of woes against authority figures who lead people astray (ch 23), and predicts that God will judge and destroy Jerusalem (chs 24–25). Jesus is arrested, tried, and executed by crucifixion (chs 26–27) for opposing the Jewish leaders and challenging the status quo. Then he is vindicated by his resurrection and gives the great commission to his disciples, to make disciples of all the nations (ch 28).\nMatthew shapes his Gospel according to two structural principles. First, following an introduction (chs 1–4), Matthew alternates teaching material with narrative material. Thus, we have discourse and teaching in chs 5–7; 10, 13, 18, 23–25; and we have narrative in chs 8–9; 11–12, 14–17, 19–22, 26–28. Second, Matthew records Jesus’ confrontation of Israel with God’s message about the arrival of his Kingdom in the last days (4:12–11:1; see 4:17), followed by the responses this message evoked from various people (11:2–20:34). Matthew then tells of Jesus Christ’s death and resurrection (chs 21–28) for the salvation of humankind.\nAuthorship\nMatthew was a tax collector whom Jesus befriended and called to a life of justice and obedience (9:9). Matthew invited many friends to spend an evening with Jesus (9:10-13), and Matthew is named among the twelve apostles (10:2-4; see also Mark 3:16-19; Luke 6:13-16; Acts 1:13). Early church tradition reports that after he composed his Gospel, Matthew moved from Palestine in the AD 60s to evangelize India (Eusebius, Church History 3.24.6).\nIn the early AD 100s, Papias, Bishop of Hierapolis, made the statement, “Matthew therefore composed the oracles in the Hebrew language [or, ‘in a Hebrew style’] and each interpreted them as he was able.” Papias’s statement is traditionally understood to mean that the apostle Matthew wrote a Gospel in Hebrew or Aramaic, and that this Gospel was later translated into Greek, perhaps by someone who also knew the Gospel of Mark. Recent studies suggest that Papias was referring to Matthew’s Jewish style, not to his language (Hebrew or Aramaic), because Matthew’s Gospel does not appear to be “translation Greek” (i.e., the type of Greek that is often found in materials translated from other languages).\nIn the 1800s, scholars became convinced that Matthew had used Mark’s Gospel as a source. These scholars argued that since an apostle would not have used another Gospel (and one written by a non-apostle at that!) to record Jesus’ life, Matthew was not the author of the Gospel bearing his name. But early tradition connects the Gospel of Mark with the apostle Peter, a fact that makes Matthew’s dependence on Mark more understandable. There is no conflict with one apostle (Matthew) using the accounts of another apostle (Peter) as a convenient source from which to shape his own report.\nOccasion of Writing\nUnlike the letters of Paul or the Revelation of John, the settings of the Gospels must be inferred from comments and emphases within the books themselves (see 24:15; 27:46; 28:15), since direct evidence is unavailable. Matthew appears to have been written at a time when Christians and Jews were fiercely debating such issues as how to obey the law (5:17-48; 15:1-20), who the Messiah is (chs 1–2), who the true people of God are (Israel or the church; 21:33-46), who the rightful leaders of God’s people are (4:18-22; 10:2-4; 21:43; 23:1-36; 28:16-20), and how Gentiles are related to the church and to Israel (2:1-12; 3:7-10; 4:12-16; 8:5-13; 15:21-28; 28:16-20).\nThere is serious debate as to whether Matthew’s Gospel sprang from a community that was still within Judaism or one that was already outside Judaism. In other words, had Matthew’s Christian community separated from Judaism, or was it still within Judaism’s umbrella? Or, was Matthew written for a general audience rather than a specific community? Early Christianity was diverse; some Christian leaders, such as James, maintained a long-term relationship with the Jewish communities. In discussing this question, scholars examine the following passages: 2:1-12; 4:12-16; 8:5-13; 10:5-6; 15:21-28; 17:24-27; 19:28; 21:43; 22:7; 23:1-39.\nDate and Location\nMatthew was probably written sometime between AD 65 and 80. Those who argue that Matthew used Mark’s Gospel as a source usually date Matthew after AD 70; those who claim it is independent tend to date it earlier. Some have suggested that Matthew’s Gospel was written in the AD 50s. Many today think that Matthew was written at Antioch in Syria, which is more probable than any other proposed setting.\nMeaning and Message\nMatthew argues the case that Jesus fulfills the ancient faith of Israel and the hope of the Old Testament: In Jesus, the Messiah and the day of the Lord have come.\nSome people do follow Jesus. In following the instruction of Jesus, these disciples would evangelize the Roman world and build a community (the church) that would include both Jews and Gentiles. In general, however, Israel refuses to follow its Messiah, and Jesus utters disastrous warnings that they will experience the judgment of God (chs 23–25) unless they repent.\nMatthew’s Gospel is distinctive in its presentation of Jesus as Messiah and Teacher, its emphasis on the Kingdom of Heaven, its strong call to discipleship, its constant pattern of Old Testament fulfillment, its incisive criticism of the Jewish religious leaders, and its universal outlook that includes Gentiles in the Kingdom.\nThe Messiah (Christ).  Matthew emphasizes Jesus as the Messiah (Christ) (1:1, 16-18; 11:2-3; 16:16, 20; 23:10). He focuses on Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament expectations, though not in the manner his Jewish contemporaries expected. For Matthew, Jesus is clearly the Son of God, born of the Virgin Mary in order to bring salvation to his people (1:21). In short, Jesus is “Immanuel, which means ‘God is with us’” (1:23; 28:20).\nThe Kingdom of Heaven.  The expression “Kingdom of Heaven,” used thirty times by Matthew, is a roundabout way for Jews to say “Kingdom of God.” Matthew uses this term to evoke (1) the invisible but present rule of God on earth through the saving work of Jesus the Messiah; (2) the fulfillment of Old Testament promises (4:17; 11:11-15); (3) the saving activity of God, often through quiet and humble means (11:25; 13:24-30, 36-43); (4) the power and strength of God’s activity (11:2-6, 12-13; 12:28); (5) the coming of the Kingdom within a “generation” (10:23; 16:28; 24:34); (6) the final, climactic judgment of God (25:31-46); and (7) the final, perfect fellowship of all God’s holy people with the Father (8:11-12; 13:43; 22:1-14; 26:29). The Kingdom of Heaven shows God’s perfect reign through Jesus the Messiah among his people, beginning with the church and consummated in the eternal Kingdom of glory and fellowship.\nDiscipleship.  Matthew’s Gospel stresses Jesus’ call to men and women to be baptized, to follow him as disciples, to obey his teachings (28:20), and to enjoy fellowship with him. Jesus summarizes the requirements of discipleship in his Sermon on the Mount (chs 5–7), and this theme recurs throughout Matthew (e.g., 10:1-42; 16:24-26). Matthew shows the disciples overcoming their failures through Christ’s help (see 14:28-33; 16:5-12).\nFulfillment of the Old Testament.  More than any other Gospel, Matthew highlights the deep correspondence between Old Testament expectations and promises and their fulfillment in Jesus. In the style of a Jewish commentary, Matthew links Old Testament texts to events in the life of Jesus that fulfill those texts and frequently draws out analogies between the Old Testament and the New Testament. Matthew’s procedure is anchored in the belief that what God has done once in Israel, he is doing again, finally and fully, in Jesus the Messiah.\nUniversal Outlook.  In a book so strongly Jewish in orientation, it is surprising to find such an emphasis on the inclusion of Gentiles in the Messiah’s saving work. More than any other, this Gospel emphasizes that the Good News is for all, including Gentiles. This stance put Matthew at odds with the Jewish community of his time on two fundamental questions: Who are the people of God? What future is there for the nation of Israel? The birth narratives show that God saves Gentiles, and throughout the book Gentiles are portrayed positively. Since God is sovereign, his Messiah is King of all creation. Though God has worked especially in and through the nation of Israel (see 10:5-6; 15:24), the inauguration of the Kingdom of Heaven shares God’s good favor with the nations as well (see 28:18-20).",

    "content": "In his opening verse, Mark provides readers with the main key to understanding his Gospel: Although we can learn much about the disciples and other characters from reading Mark, it is most important to understand what he is teaching about Jesus: Jesus is “the Messiah, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1).\nSetting\nIt is generally agreed that Mark was the first of the four canonical Gospels to be written. Before the writing of Mark, there were no Gospels as such. The gospel traditions were circulated or “delivered” orally under the supervision of the eyewitnesses and ministers of the word of God (Luke 1:2). As these eyewitnesses began to die, it became important to record the gospel traditions in writing. According to church tradition, after the martyrdom of Peter in the mid-60s AD, the church in Rome asked John Mark to put into writing the accounts of Jesus’ life and teachings that Peter had delivered to them orally. As a result, Mark became the first to compose what we call a “Gospel,” a written account of Jesus’ life and teachings, from the oral materials about Jesus.\nSummary\nThe overall structure of Mark is geographical. The first nine chapters narrate events of Jesus’ ministry in Galilee and its environs. In 10:1-52, Jesus and the disciples travel from Galilee to Jerusalem, and the last chapters of the book (11:1–16:20) take place in and around Jerusalem. (Matthew and Luke, in their use of Mark, followed this geographical outline, but John organized his Gospel in a different way.)\nWithin the geographical outline, Mark has arranged much of his material topically. Thus we have collections of miracle stories (1:21-45; 4:35–5:43), controversy stories (2:1–3:6; 12:13-37), parables (4:1-34), and teachings about the end (13:5-37). Some of the materials include indicators of chronological sequence: Jesus’ ministry began with his baptism (1:2-11; see Acts 1:22; 10:37) and temptation (Mark 1:12-13); his suffering, death, and resurrection occurred at the end (11:1–16:8). A few individual accounts are tied together chronologically, such as Peter’s confession at Caesarea Philippi (8:27-33) and Jesus’ transfiguration (9:1-13; see also 1:29, 35).\nThe major turning point in Jesus’ ministry is highlighted in 8:27-33, very near the center of the book. At Caesarea Philippi, the disciples confess for the first time their belief that Jesus is the Messiah (8:29). Upon this acknowledgment, Jesus “began to tell them” of his forthcoming death and resurrection (8:31; cp. Matt 16:21). Jesus’ death and resurrection are the dominant theme of 8:31–16:8.\nAuthor\nThe earliest known reference to the authorship of Mark comes from Papias at the beginning of the second century. The early church historian Eusebius quotes Papias as having said, “Mark became Peter’s interpreter and wrote accurately all that he remembered, not, indeed, in order, of the things said or done by the Lord. For he had not heard the Lord, nor had he followed him, but later on . . . followed Peter” (Eusebius, Church History 3.39.16).\nThe early church was unanimous in attributing this Gospel to John Mark. It is unlikely that Papias and others would have attributed this Gospel to a non-apostle with a tarnished reputation (see Acts 13:13; 15:36-41) unless Mark were in fact the author.\nThe author of this Gospel was bilingual, as the Aramaic phrases in its Greek text suggest (e.g., Mark 5:41; 7:34; 15:34). He was also Jewish, in that he knew and explained various Jewish customs to his Gentile readers (e.g., 7:3-4; 14:12). John Mark was indeed a Jew who was raised in Jerusalem (Acts 12:12). He thus knew Aramaic (the native language of the people of Judea) and was familiar with Jewish customs.\nSome have objected that this Gospel does not clearly indicate a connection between Mark and Peter and that it looks more polished as a literary composition than one might expect from a direct record of Peter’s eyewitness testimony. But if this Gospel was written near or after Peter’s death (see “Date” below), Peter had been telling these stories for over thirty years. Through continual retelling, his gospel account would have been become well polished. There are also references to Peter in this Gospel that might be due to Mark’s personal connection with him (e.g., Mark 1:16-20; 8:32-33; 9:5-6; 14:28-31, 66-72). It fits the evidence well to consider this Gospel as having indeed been written by John Mark, Barnabas’s cousin, based on Peter’s gospel accounts.\nDate\nJohn Mark probably wrote down Peter’s teaching about Jesus around the time of Peter’s death. Peter died in Rome around AD 64 in the persecution that Nero waged against Christians. Mark probably wrote this Gospel in the late 60s, and a couple of considerations support this hypothesis. (1) The emphasis on faithfulness in time of persecution (4:17; 8:34-38; 10:30; 13:9-13) suggests a time during or shortly after Nero’s persecution in the mid-60s. And (2) The discourse of Jesus recorded in chapter 13 suggests that the destruction of Jerusalem was rapidly drawing near—the Jewish revolt (AD 66–73) had probably already begun.\nAudience\nThe Gospel of Mark was written for the church in Rome, according to tradition. It is clear that the original readers were Greek-speaking and that they were Gentiles, because the author explains Jewish customs (e.g., 7:3-4; 14:12) and distinguishes his readers from “the Jews” (7:3).\nThe original readers were Christians. They were familiar with the gospel traditions, for the author does not explain various Old Testament references (2:25-26) or such things as who John the Baptist was (1:2-8), who Isaiah the prophet was (1:2), or who the Pharisees and teachers of religious law were (7:1).\nIt is also apparent that the readers were Romans, as indicated by the “Latinisms” in Mark. In 6:27, he uses a Latin word meaning “soldier”; in 12:42, he uses a Roman coin (the quadran) to explain the meaning of “two lepta” (Greek coins); and in 15:39, 44-45, he uses the Latin word “centurion” rather than the Greek word with the same meaning that Matthew and Luke use.\nLiterary Features\nMark’s own editorial work can be seen most clearly in his introductory statements (e.g., 1:21-22; 2:1; 4:1; 7:1), in his explanatory comments (e.g., 1:16; 2:15; 5:8, 28, 42; 6:14, 17, 20, 52; 7:3-4), and in his summaries (e.g., 1:14-15, 34, 39; 3:7-12; 6:53-56).\nMark repeats various terms and expressions to show progress, such as “suddenly,” “at once,” and “immediately” (e.g., 1:23; 3:6; 6:45). He uses the Greek present tense in the narrative, rather than a simple past tense, to give a sense of immediacy (e.g., 1:12, 21, 38, 40, 44; 2:3; 3:13). Mark also often sandwiches one story within another (e.g., 3:22-30 into 3:20-21, 31-35; 5:25-34 into 5:21-24, 35-43; 11:15-19 into 11:12-14, 20-26); in the last example, this sandwiching indicates that the middle part (11:15-19, the cleansing of the Temple) is to be understood in light of the story surrounding it (11:12-14, 20-26, the cursing of the fig tree)—the cleansing of the Temple was a symbolic act of judgment (cp. 13:3-37). Thus, Mark’s editorial work relates different events and shows meaningful connections.\nMeaning and Message\nThe Person of Christ.  Mark’s major theological emphasis is the identity of Jesus of Nazareth. This emphasis is stated in the opening verse of the Gospel: Mark wanted his readers to know that Jesus of Nazareth is “the Messiah, the Son of God.” The title “Son of God” occurs frequently in Mark, and there are diverse witnesses to Jesus’ status as God’s son: the demons (1:34; 3:11; 5:7; cp. 1:24); God himself (1:11; 9:7); Mark, the author (1:1); a Roman centurion (15:39); and Jesus himself (12:6; 13:32; 14:61-62). Other titles for Jesus occur in Mark’s Gospel, including Jesus’ own favorite, “Son of Man” (e.g., 2:10). But in Mark’s Gospel all of these titles, as well as his actions (e.g., 1:22; 4:41), point to his identity as the Christ (or Messiah), the Son of God.\nDuring his life, the Son of God needed to protect himself and his followers from the prevailing misconceptions in the minds of the people about what the term “Christ” (or “Messiah”) meant (see “The Secret of the Messiah” below). Jesus’ ultimate mission as the Son of God is explained through his death, in which he gave his life as a ransom for many. The call to Christian discipleship is a call to follow the Messiah, the Son of God, especially in his servanthood and sacrifice. Jesus’ ministry as Son of God during his life on earth also points forward to his return as the Son of God, ruling God’s Kingdom.\nThe Death of Jesus.  The Gospel of Mark puts a lot of emphasis on the account of Jesus’ passion—his suffering, death, and resurrection. Throughout the Gospel we find numerous references to the death of Jesus (2:19-20; 3:6; 8:31; 9:9, 12, 31; 10:33-34, 45; 12:1-11; 14:1-11, 21, 24-25, 36, 14:64–15:47). Mark emphasizes that Jesus’ death was part of God’s plan. His death was a divine necessity (8:31), for God had willed it (10:45; 14:36). The Old Testament also teaches of the Messiah’s death (see 9:12; 14:21, 27, 49). Jesus came to give his life as a ransom for many (10:45) and to pour out his blood sacrificially in order to establish a new covenant (14:24).\nChristian Discipleship.  Mark emphasizes the importance of following Jesus by denying oneself and taking up one’s cross (see 8:34). Christian discipleship does not permit a half-hearted response but requires leaving everything to follow Jesus (1:18, 20; 10:21, 29). Christian discipleship might even bring persecution and martyrdom (13:9-13a), but Christians are promised that endurance in faith means salvation (13:13) and eternal life (10:30).\nThe “Secret of the Messiah.”  Throughout Mark’s Gospel, Jesus tells others not to broadcast his true identity. This is likely because of the tendency for people to misunderstand who he is and what he has come to do. Yet the secret is not and cannot be kept (7:36). Jesus creates such wonder and amazement that he simply cannot remain hidden. But while the characters in the story struggle to grasp Jesus’ identity correctly, Mark’s readers have the privilege of understanding the full picture of Jesus’ identity in light of his death and resurrection.\nThe Coming of God’s Kingdom.  The arrival of God’s Kingdom is central to Jesus’ message. People need to repent and believe the gospel because the Kingdom of God has arrived (1:14-15). Old Testament promises are being fulfilled. Life in the Kingdom is different from what it was during the time awaiting the Kingdom.",

    "content": "Luke describes the coming of Jesus as good news for the entire world—for people of every race, age, gender, ethnic group, and social position. With John the Baptist as his prophetic forerunner, Jesus came as the Son of God and as the Messiah, the King descended from David who defeats Satan and brings salvation and healing. As Jesus served and taught the people and proclaimed good news, the religious leaders opposed him. Jesus went to Jerusalem as the suffering servant, proclaimed judgment on the nation before being executed as a criminal, then rose from the dead to fulfill God’s plan and launch his Spirit-driven mission to all the world. The risen Jesus, the Jewish Messiah, is the Savior of the whole world.\nSetting\nLuke was written in the context of the growing conflict between the church and the synagogue in the mid-to-late first century AD. The early church did not view itself as a new religion, but as the fulfillment and completion of Judaism. The promises made to the Jews in the Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament) were fulfilled through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and continued to be fulfilled through the missionary movement of the early church. During this time, more and more Gentiles (non-Jews) came into the church, while many Jews rejected the Good News. Division grew between those who believed that Jesus was the Messiah and those who denied this claim.\nThe pressing question in this conflict became, Who are the true people of God? Are they the church, made up of Jews and Gentiles who believe that Jesus is the Messiah? Or are they the Jews who reject Jesus as a false messiah? Luke addresses this question and demonstrates that Jesus is indeed the Messiah who calls all people, Jew and Gentile, to put their faith in him.\nSummary\nLuke’s Gospel begins with a formal prologue, written in the style of the fine Greco-Roman writers of Luke’s day (1:1-4). This prologue demonstrates the author’s literary skills and sets out the purpose of his work: to write a reliable historical account of the life of Jesus that would confirm the truth of the Christian message.\nAfter this formal literary introduction, the writing style changes dramatically. Luke describes Jesus’ birth (1:5–2:51) in a Jewish manner reminiscent of the Greek Old Testament. This birth narrative clearly shows the Jewish roots of the gospel message and introduces themes that are developed in the rest of Luke and Acts.\nIn common with Matthew and Mark, Luke introduces Jesus’ public ministry with accounts of John the Baptist (3:1-20), Jesus’ baptism (3:21-22), Jesus’ temptation (4:1-13), and descriptions of his ministry in and around Galilee (4:14–9:50). Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God, taught with authority, healed the sick, and cast out demons, demonstrating the authority of the Kingdom in his words and actions. As in Matthew and Mark, the high point of Jesus’ Galilean ministry was Peter’s confession that Jesus is the Messiah, followed by Jesus’ explanation that the Messiah must suffer and die in Jerusalem (9:18-22). Jesus then headed toward Jerusalem to fulfill this mission (9:51–19:44). In this travel narrative—the most distinctive structural feature of Luke’s Gospel—the author recounts many of Jesus’ beloved stories and parables: the Good Samaritan, the Prodigal Son, the Rich Man and Lazarus, the story of Mary and Martha, and the Zacchaeus episode. The central theme of this section is God’s love for the lost and Jesus’ ministry to sinners, poor people, and outcasts. The theme of the entire Gospel is stated at the end of the Zacchaeus episode: “The Son of Man came to seek and save those who are lost” (19:10).\nThe climax of the narrative is Jesus’ arrest, trial, and crucifixion (22:1–23:56). The central theme of the crucifixion in Luke is Jesus’ innocence. Jesus is portrayed as the righteous suffering servant of the Lord (see Isa 52:13–53:12). At Jesus’ death, the Roman officer at the foot of the cross cried out, “Surely this man was innocent” (Luke 23:47).\nThe narrative resolves with Jesus’ resurrection (24:1-12). Luke’s most distinctive contribution here is the account of the disciples on the road to Emmaus (24:13-35). As he walked with two discouraged disciples who did not recognize him, Jesus taught them that his death was not a failure, but a fulfillment of Old Testament promises. All of Scripture anticipated this great salvation event (24:25-27). The narrative ends with a brief account of the Ascension (24:50-53), which is described more fully in the book of Acts (Acts 1:1-11).\nStructurally, Luke follows Mark’s basic outline, with a Galilean ministry followed by a journey to Jerusalem and the climax of Jesus’ ministry there. The main differences are: (1) Like Matthew, Luke begins with a birth narrative, which serves as a thematic introduction to the work (Luke 1:1–2:52); (2) Luke omits one major section of Mark’s account of the Galilean ministry, sometimes called his “great omission” (Mark 6:45–8:26); and (3) Luke expands Mark’s account of the journey to Jerusalem from a single chapter (Mark 10:1-52) to ten chapters (Luke 9:51–19:44) and includes here a great deal of Jesus’ teaching and his ministry to outcasts in Israel.\nLuke as Literature\nLuke’s Gospel must be read and interpreted alongside its companion volume, the book of Acts. Luke and Acts are two volumes of a single work written by the same author (Luke). The two are a literary and theological unity—when Luke wrote his Gospel, he already had the writing of Acts in mind. Themes introduced in the Gospel, such as the salvation of the Gentiles, reach their narrative completion in the book of Acts. Scholars often refer to this single two-volume work as “Luke–Acts.”\nLuke’s purpose in writing gives his Gospel, like the other three Gospels, a unique perspective and emphasis that can best be understood by reading Luke’s Gospel as a distinct account of Christ’s life. However, it can also be beneficial to compare the accounts in the different Gospels.\nAuthorship\nThough all of the Gospels are, strictly speaking, anonymous (their authors do not name themselves), the author of Luke–Acts can be identified readily as Luke, a physician and sometime companion of the apostle Paul. In several first-person plural passages in Acts (the “we” sections), the author describes himself as a participant in Paul’s missionary activities (Acts 16:10-17; 20:5-17; 21:1-18; 27:1–28:16). Luke was a Gentile (Col 4:11-14), and one of his central themes is that God’s salvation is for Gentiles as well as for Jews.\nLuke evidently came to faith in Christ through the ministry of the apostle Paul. Even though he was not present during the earthly ministry of Jesus, he was a careful and astute historian. He drew on eyewitness accounts and on written and oral sources as he thoroughly investigated the events he reported. His purpose was to write so that “you can be certain of the truth of everything you were taught” (Luke 1:4).\nOccasion and Place of Writing\nThe specific place of writing is uncertain, but Rome, Ephesus, Caesarea, and Achaia (southern Greece) have all been suggested. The date is also uncertain. The two most common theories are that it was written at an earlier date, AD 59–63, or at a later date, AD 70–90. The earlier date is suggested by the ending of Acts, with Paul alive and in prison in Rome for two years (beginning around AD 60). If the Gospel was written before Acts, a date shortly before or during this imprisonment is likely (AD 59–63). A later date, after AD 70, has been proposed by those who believe that Luke used Mark’s Gospel as a source and that Mark was written in the late 60s, just before or during the Jewish war of AD 66–70 (see Mark 13:14).\nRecipients\nLuke addressed his work to a man named Theophilus (“one who loves God”), most likely a patron who sponsored the expensive task of researching and writing a book of this length. Theophilus might have been a questioning unbeliever, but more likely he was a believer who desired more instruction concerning the origin of the Christian faith. The individual address is like a dedication. Luke–Acts was probably also intended for a larger Christian audience, one made up primarily of Gentile Christians, but with some Jewish Christians as well. These believers were seeking confirmation and assurance that God’s plan of salvation was continuing, despite the rejection of Jesus by many of the Jews. Luke was affirming that the church, made up of both Jews and Gentiles who have accepted Jesus as the Messiah, represents the true people of God in the present age.\nMeaning and Message\nThe narrative of Luke–Acts positively affirms (1) that Jesus is the Messiah promised in the Old Testament Scriptures; (2) that his death on the cross did not negate this claim, because the Messiah’s death and resurrection were predicted in Scripture all along (Luke 24:26, 46); (3) that the mission to the Gentiles was initiated by the Spirit of God, was predicted in Scripture, and was part of God’s purpose of bringing salvation to the whole world in the last days; and (4) that the Jews and Gentiles who make up the church are the people of God. The central theme of Luke’s Gospel is that God’s salvation, promised in the Scriptures, was fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nA Historical Message.  More than any other Gospel writer, Luke affirms that the story of Jesus is historical, and he assures his readers that the gospel message is authentic. He emphasizes that his account is based on reliable eyewitness testimony (1:1-4) and meticulously dates Jesus’ ministry with reference to the rulers of his day (3:1-2).\nPortrait of Jesus.  Luke’s portrait of Jesus reflects a theme of promise and fulfillment. Jesus is introduced as the promised Savior, the Messiah descended from King David. He was born in Bethlehem, the city of David, and will reign forever on David’s throne (1:32-33; 2:4, 11). Jesus did not accomplish salvation through military power and conquest, but by suffering the fate of the prophets. He died as the servant of the Lord, fulfilling the promises of the Old Testament. Through his death and resurrection, Jesus became the Savior of the world (Luke 2:11; Acts 2:36; 10:36). His servants now take this message of salvation to the ends of the earth.\nSalvation for Outsiders.  Luke emphasizes salvation for all who believe, especially with reference to the outsiders of Israel: the poor, sinners, despised Samaritans, women, and Gentiles.\n(1) The poor. The Kingdom of God brings a great reversal of fortunes. God exalts the poor and the humble, and he will humble the rich and the arrogant (Luke 1:51-55; 16:19-31). The gospel is good news for the poor and oppressed (4:18) because they most recognize their need for God (6:20-21). It is impossible for the rich to enter the Kingdom when they trust in their riches instead of in God (12:13-21; 18:18-30).\n(2) Sinners. God’s love for the lost is revealed most clearly in Jesus’ association with sinners and tax collectors. He called a despised tax collector, Levi, to be his disciple. As the Great Physician, Jesus came to heal the “sick” (sinners), not the “healthy” (the self-righteous; 5:27-32). He commended an immoral woman who anointed his feet because she recognized God’s forgiveness and loved greatly in response (7:36-50). He rebuked the Pharisees and teachers of religious law for their self-righteousness, hypocrisy, and lack of compassion. The repentant tax collector in the Temple received forgiveness, while the self-righteous Pharisee gained nothing (18:9-14). Even the chief tax collector Zacchaeus was forgiven when he repented and turned to God (19:1-10). Jesus forgave and offered a place in paradise to the repentant criminal on the cross (23:39-43). And Jesus’ parables express this same theme—for example, the father forgave his prodigal son when he returned to him (15:11-32). The message throughout the Gospel is that the coming of God’s Kingdom brings forgiveness to all who repent and believe.\n(3) Samaritans. The Samaritans were despised outsiders, but in Luke, Jesus commends a Samaritan for his gratitude to God when he was healed of leprosy (17:11-19), and Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan, in which a despised Samaritan was the only true neighbor to a wounded Jew (10:29-37). God’s salvation does not depend on ethnic identity or social status, but on a repentant heart and a life of love for God and others.\n(4) Women. In first-century culture, women were viewed as inferiors, but Jesus elevated women to a position of dignity in the Kingdom of God. Luke’s Gospel gives special prominence to women and mentions thirteen women who are not found in the other Gospels. The birth narrative is told from the perspective of women (Mary and Elizabeth). Luke alone mentions the women who financially supported Jesus (8:1-3). And in his story of Mary and Martha, Mary is commended for learning as a disciple at Jesus’ feet (10:38-42).\n(5) Gentiles. The ultimate outsiders were the Gentiles, and Luke emphasizes that God’s salvation extends even to them. Though arising within Israel, Jesus would be “a light to reveal God to the nations” (2:32), and “all people [would] see the salvation sent from God” (3:4-6; Isa 40:5). While Matthew’s genealogy (Matt 1:1-17) emphasizes Jesus’ Jewish ancestry by beginning with Abraham, the father of the Israelites, Luke’s genealogy goes all the way back to Adam, the father of the entire human race (Luke 3:23-38). In his sermon at Nazareth, Jesus declared that God had always demonstrated grace toward the Gentiles (4:24-27). Luke’s message is that God loves all people everywhere and desires that all who are lost should be found (15:1-32; 19:10).\nRejection by Many in Israel.  The dark side of this inclusion of the Gentiles and other outsiders is that Jesus’ message was rejected by many in Israel. At Nazareth, when he announced that God had blessed Gentiles in the past, the people rose up in anger to kill him (4:28-30). This episode initiated the rejection of Jesus by his own people and anticipated the Jewish opposition to the church (as recounted in Acts). Jerusalem rejected its Messiah and so stood under God’s judgment (Luke 13:33-35; 19:41-44), and this pattern continues in Acts. While many in Israel believed the gospel, still more rejected it. Israel was divided, and the gospel went out to the Gentiles. Luke emphasizes that this did not negate the gospel message; Israel’s rejection of the gospel was predicted in the Old Testament Scriptures and was a continuation of Israel’s history of stubbornness and hard-heartedness (11:29-32, 47-51; 13:34-35; 19:41-44; 23:27-31; Acts 13:46; 28:25-28; see also Rom 9–11).",

    "content": "John wrote his Gospel to inspire faith. John knew Jesus intimately, and John’s Gospel provides an intimate portrait of the Lord. John referred to himself as “the disciple Jesus loved.” His Gospel has become the “beloved Gospel” of the church. Here we meet Nicodemus, the Samaritan woman at the well, Lazarus, and doubting Thomas. John records for us many of Jesus’ most memorable sayings, longest sermons, and most profound miracles. Here we meet God face to face.\nSetting\nA small community of Christians lived in ancient Ephesus during the late first century AD. They had learned the remarkable news about Jesus and accounts of his life from the apostle Paul. Eventually, the apostle John moved to Ephesus and settled there, bringing his own recollections of Jesus’ life and ministry. In his later years, John wrote these recollections down, providing his followers—and us—with the fourth Gospel.\nJohn’s desire above all was for his followers to believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (John 20:31). He realized that they had not had the privilege of seeing Jesus’ many signs and miracles as he had (John 20:29). John’s authority and deep experience with Jesus ring out from every story he told. As an eyewitness to Jesus’ life (John 19:35), John had heard, seen, and touched the Word of life (see 1 Jn 1:1-4) and was a valuable source of many stories that are unique to his Gospel.\nAs the Christians of Ephesus told their fellow citizens about Jesus, they quickly found themselves debating about Jesus with rabbis in the local synagogues. Was Jesus truly the Son of God? How could he be the Messiah? Can Christians legitimately claim to be “children of Abraham”? Could anyone prove that Jesus’ claim of being sent from God was true? Guided by the Holy Spirit in his teaching and writing, John brilliantly led his Christian readers through these debates.\nTensions grew. As small churches grew up alongside synagogues, more Jews converted. Opposition to the Christian believers was inevitable. But John stood by the church during terrible persecution and conflict. When it seemed that the fledgling church’s struggle with the prestigious synagogue community would overwhelm them, John courageously gave witness to the ministry of Jesus Christ. When false teachers later brought internal controversy and conflict to the church, John again gave the community strength. Writing letters to encourage and exhort (see 1, 2, and 3 John), John became the heroic pastor–theologian of the churches in Asia Minor.\nJohn’s writing is as beloved today as it was in the earliest years of the church. Few books of the Bible have influenced Christian life and thought like John’s profound and dynamic Gospel. By combining intimacy of expression with penetrating insight, John provides a deeply satisfying portrait of Christ.\nSummary\nJohn divided his Gospel into two main sections, which comprise chs 1–12 and chs 13–21. The first section, which is often called “The Book of Signs,” tells about Jesus’ public ministry of revealing himself to the Jewish world. The second section, often called “The Book of Glory,” records Jesus’ private words to his disciples and tells of his death and resurrection.\nChapters 1–12.  The Gospel prologue (1:1-18) artfully summarizes the entrance of God’s Word into the world. Jesus was baptized and called his earliest followers (1:19-51). Then a series of remarkable events (chs 2–4) highlights Jesus’ revelation of himself to the Jews. At a wedding in Cana, Jesus turned water into wine. In Jerusalem, he used a whip to drive corruption and money-dealing out of the Temple. He debated the meaning of spiritual rebirth with a rabbi named Nicodemus. At a well in Samaria, he met a woman with a checkered marital history and offered her “living water,” which no well can ever provide. In each of these events, Jesus unveiled his identity.\nIn the following section (chs 5–10), Jesus appears at a number of Jewish festivals, using ancient Old Testament symbols and practices to reveal himself to God’s people. On the Sabbath, Jesus worked by healing a lame man. On Passover, Jesus provided bread for five thousand. In the symbolic light of the Festival of Shelters, Jesus healed a blind man, reinforcing his own identity as the light of the world. John’s clear message is that Jesus came to fulfill what Judaism had promised since Old Testament times.\nThen Jesus began to prepare for his death and resurrection. John describes Jesus’ arrival in Bethany, a town just east of Jerusalem (ch 11). His friend Lazarus had died, and Jesus raised him to life. Following this remarkable event, Jesus made his final public appeal to the world to believe in him and his mission (ch 12).\nChapters 13–21.  John turns to Jesus’ death and resurrection, reminding readers that the cross is not a sign of despair but a picture of glory. Jesus was returning to the Father and needed to prepare his disciples for his departure. At his final Passover meal, Jesus disclosed to his disciples the things nearest to his heart (chs 13–17). He told them candidly about his death and departure to the Father. He reassured them that he would not abandon them, but that he would return and turn their sorrow into joy. He promised them the gift of the Holy Spirit. Finally, Jesus prayed for them.\nFollowing this Passover meal, Jesus led his followers east of the city and across a valley to an olive grove called Gethsemane (ch 18). Judas, who had agreed to betray Jesus, soon appeared with a large contingent of Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Following his arrest, Jesus stood before the Jewish high council to be interrogated, first by Annas and then by Caiaphas, the reigning high priest. By morning, the Jewish leaders took Jesus to the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, who asked probing questions about Jesus’ identity. Pilate, coaxed by the Jewish leaders, decided to have Jesus crucified (ch 19).\nThe climax of John’s Gospel is Jesus’ resurrection from the dead (ch 20). This event begins a series of dramatic accounts in which Jesus appeared to his followers and encouraged them. He gave them the Holy Spirit and commissioned them to represent him to the world. Jesus then gave his disciples their marching orders (ch 21). He reminded them of his power (21:1-14); reinstated Peter, who had denied him (21:15-17); and instructed Peter to follow him in his mission (21:18-19).\nAuthor and Date\nAs with the other Gospels, John provides no explicit evidence as to its author, although the enigmatic figure of the “beloved disciple” provides clear clues (see 13:23; 19:26-27; 20:2-10; 21:7, 20-24). The Gospel of John must be connected with this person, for he is identified as the eyewitness source of this record of Jesus’ life (19:35; 21:20-24).\nWho was this beloved disciple? Beginning in AD 125, leaders in the early church wrote that he was the apostle John, the son of Zebedee, who was living in Ephesus when he wrote this Gospel (see, e.g., Eusebius, Church History 3.23). John was one of the Twelve and, along with James (his brother) and Peter, was part of an inner circle around Jesus (see e.g., Matt 26:36-37; Mark 5:37; 9:2). The Gospel of John reflects this close perspective. Most scholars believe that John completed writing his Gospel by around AD 90.\nRecpients\nJohn most likely wrote his Gospel for Jewish Christians living in Ephesus, Asia Minor, and the broader Mediterranean world. These believers were caught between Jewish and Greek cultures, and their grasp of Judaism may have been slipping.\nWhile John’s knowledge of Palestine and Judaism is reflected throughout his Gospel, he assumed that his audience was unfamiliar with some particulars of Jesus’ world. For example, he explained that rabbi is a Hebrew word meaning “teacher” (1:38), and he gave an alternate name for the Sea of Galilee (6:1). At the same time, John assumed that his readers were familiar with Jewish traditions, concepts, and festivals. They were probably also familiar with the basic story presented in Mark’s Gospel. For example, John refers to John the Baptist’s imprisonment (3:24) without ever telling the complete story.\nMeaning and Message\nRevelation and Redemption.  “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it” (1:5). The light of God has inhabited the world: Christ reveals the Father (14:9). In Christ we see the glory of God in a human being. And even though Jesus was persecuted, tried, and crucified, the light cannot be extinguished. Jesus’ purpose in revealing God is to redeem people: “The Word gave life to everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone” (1:4). Those who embrace Christ’s revelation and redemption with faith will gain eternal life.\nWorship and the Spirit.  Worship must take place “in spirit and in truth” (4:24), energized and informed by the Spirit of God. Nicodemus had to be born of “water and Spirit” to enter the Kingdom of God (3:5). In Galilee, after feeding the 5,000, Jesus told the crowd that living bread is available in his body, which was to be sacrificed. He instructed them to consume his body and blood, symbolic of the Lord’s Supper (6:51-59). Yet worship that is focused only on the individual elements and not accompanied by the Spirit of God is worth nothing (see 6:63).\nJesus Christ.  John recorded Jesus’ descriptions about his nature, origin, and relationship to the Father. Jesus affirmed his oneness with the Father (10:30; 14:9-10) and their unity of purpose (5:17; 8:42), as well as their personal distinctiveness (14:28; 17:1-5). Jesus even used the very title (“I Am”) that God used for himself in the Old Testament, thus affirming his own deity (see 8:58; 18:4-5; Exod 3:13-14).\nThe Holy Spirit.  John’s Gospel underscores the work of the Holy Spirit as a central feature of Jesus’ human experience (chs 4, 7) and of our lives (chs 3, 14, and 16). The transforming power of God’s Spirit is a hallmark of true discipleship.\nThe Mission of the Church.  God sent Jesus into the world (8:18) to proclaim his glory and to testify to the Good News of redemption. After his departure, the Son continued this mission through the Spirit (16:5-11), who in turn would fill the church and empower believers to fulfill the mission of Jesus in the world (20:20-23; Matt 28:18-20; Acts 1:7-8).\nThe End Times.  Early Christians anticipated the return of Christ, and John affirms this anticipation. Yet in the meantime, believers can experience Jesus’ longed-for presence in the Holy Spirit. Jesus’ announcement of the Spirit’s coming echoes the language of his own second coming (see 14:15-26). In a vital way, Jesus is already with us in the Spirit as we continue to look forward to Christ’s personal return at the end of history.",

    "content": "The book of Acts has a central role in the New Testament: It connects Jesus with the emerging Christian community, and the Gospels with the rest of the New Testament. It frames the proclamation of the Christian message in both Jewish and Gentile settings and underscores the key roles of Peter and Paul in the spread of the Good News throughout the Mediterranean. It is the story of a dynamic message with an outreach to all.\nSetting\nLuke wrote at a time when the Good News about Jesus Christ was spreading from Jerusalem throughout the Mediterranean world. Luke was probably a Gentile (non-Jew), and his material on Christian origins keeps the needs and outlook of the wider world in mind.\nLuke began his presentation of the message of Christ with an account of Jesus’ life (the Gospel of Luke). In the book of Acts, Luke describes how the Christian faith was carried across the Mediterranean world.\nIt was important for Luke to show that God’s love and mercy reaches out to all people—“God shows no favoritism,” as Peter told Cornelius (10:34). Christ is the only Savior (4:12), and all can believe in him for salvation and new life (see 16:30-31). Despite the tendency of Jewish Christians to keep God’s grace to themselves, the church came to the united conclusion that Gentiles are fully included in God’s promises (see 15:1-31). The message of the forgiveness of sins and new life through Christ is for all nations.\nSummary\nThe apostles and other followers of Christ were filled with the Spirit and empowered to carry out the great commission (Matt 28:18-20). Acts specifically highlights the ministries of Peter (Acts 1:1–12:25) and Paul (13:1–28:31).\nActs follows a geographical outline based on 1:8. The Christian message and community of believers spread in Jerusalem (1:1–8:3), in Palestine and Syria (8:4–12:25), and in the Gentile world throughout the Roman empire (13:1–28:31). The closing word in the Greek text of Acts (akōlutōs, “unhindered,” 28:31) recalls the unhindered spread of the gospel to Jews (3:1–5:42), Samaritans (6:1–8:40), “God-fearers” (8:26-40; 9:32–11:18), and Gentiles (11:19-30; 13:1–28:31).\nPurposes of Acts\nHistory.  Acts describes people, places, and events involved in the early spread of the Good News.\nGeography.  Acts shows how the message was taken from Jerusalem to Rome (1:8; 9:15).\nBiography.  Acts highlights the ministries of Peter and Paul, who, along with James, were the principal figures leading the early Christian movement. Other influential early Christians—including Stephen, Philip, and Barnabas—also play a significant role.\nEvangelism.  Acts gives clear examples of how Christian leaders proclaimed the Good News to different audiences (note the speeches of chs 2–5, 7, 10, 13, 22, 26). Acts shows that the gospel is open to all—not only to Jews but also to Gentiles (2:8-11; 8:26-40; 10:1–11:18), and not only to men but also to women (5:14; 8:12; 16:13-15; 17:4, 12, 34; 18:26; 21:9).\nPolitics.  Acts presents a strong defense of the Christian faith to Jews (4:8-12; 7:2-53) and to Gentiles (24:10-21; 26:1-23). Luke argued that Christianity was entitled to the same protection Judaism enjoyed as a religio licita (“permitted religion”) and that it presented no danger to the Roman state (18:14-16; 19:37; 23:29; 25:25; 26:32).\nAuthorship\nLuke was Paul’s traveling companion (see 16:10 and footnote there) and was with Paul during his later years (2 Tim 4:11). Several passages in Acts appear in the first person (“we”; 16:10-18; 20:5-15; 21:1-18; 27:1–28:16), which suggests that Luke was with Paul for those parts of his journeys. In Colossians, Luke is referred to as the “beloved doctor,” listed as one of several non-Jews who were working with Paul (Col 4:11-14; see also Phlm 1:24). Paul was grateful for Luke’s love and support as a faithful coworker and friend.\nLuke was also apparently the author of the Gospel that bears his name. The theological viewpoint is consistent throughout both works. Each book highlights the historical reality of God’s action in redemption, the role of the Holy Spirit, the central place of prayer, the importance of angels, and the fulfillment of Old Testament promises in the life of Jesus and in the Christian community. Luke saw God as governing the course of history for the outworking of the divine purpose.\nAs a responsible Hellenistic historian, Luke used good historical methods and described his procedures in detail, showing concern to write an accurate and orderly account of the truth of Christian origins (Luke 1:1-4). Where other sources can verify Luke’s writings, he proves to have been careful and accurate in handling historical details. Luke was also a literary artist, a gifted storyteller who perceived and clearly portrayed the hand of God in the development of the Christian mission and community. He is one of the most important historical writers between Polybius, “the last of the great Greek historians” (100s BC), and Eusebius, the first major church historian (AD 275–339).\nPlace and Date of Writing\nThe precise location from which Acts was written is unknown, but Rome is likely.\nActs is generally dated between the early 60s AD and the end of the expected life span of Paul’s coworkers and traveling companions (mid-80s AD). Many scholars have opted for a date after AD 70, arguing that Luke used Mark as one of his sources (presuming that Mark was written in the late 60s). However, Acts makes no mention of the outcome of Paul’s trial (around AD 62); the death of James, the Lord’s brother (early 60s AD); the persecution of Christians carried out by Nero following the fire of Rome in AD 64; the deaths of Peter and Paul (around AD 64–65) and Nero (AD 68); the Jewish revolt (AD 66); or the destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70). Acts ends with Paul under house arrest (AD 60–62). Thus, a valid case can be made that Luke wrote Acts before AD 64. Those who date Acts after AD 70 would answer that Luke omits these events because they were not pertinent to his purpose (see Acts 1:8; 9:15; 28:31).\nRecipients\nThe book of Acts is the second volume of a two-part work (see Luke 1:1-4; Acts 1:1-2). The prime recipient of Luke’s Gospel and the book of Acts was Theophilus (Luke 1:3; Acts 1:1), whose name means “one who loves God.” Theophilus is described by the title, “most honorable” (Luke 1:3), which is used elsewhere for Roman governors such as Felix and Festus (23:26; 24:2-3; 26:25). Theophilus may have been Luke’s patron and benefactor. He was a Gentile who had received Christian instruction (Luke 1:4). Luke wanted him and others to have an accurate understanding of the Christian faith and of its spread into the Mediterranean world so they could be “certain of the truth” concerning Christianity (Luke 1:4).\nLiterary Characteristics\nThe material of Acts is presented carefully and precisely (e.g., 11:28; 18:2), and the accuracy of the information has often been affirmed by archaeology, geography, and related studies. Luke has combined historical accuracy and detail with a gift for vivid and dramatic descriptions (e.g., 5:17-32; 12:1-17; 14:8-20; 16:11-40; 27:1-44).\nActs is punctuated by the powerful speeches of Peter, Stephen, James, and Paul (2:14-40; 7:2-53; 15:13-21; 22:3-21). The varied literary styles in Acts fit the cultural settings in a remarkable way. Peter’s sermon on the day of Pentecost has a strongly Jewish character (2:14-40), while Paul’s preaching before the cultured Greek philosophers in Athens uses the forms of Greek oratory (17:22-31). These characteristics all support the historical authenticity of the book, as well as the literary skill of its writer.\nMeaning and Message\nActs shows that the Christian faith truly fulfills God’s promises in the Hebrew Scriptures (2:16-36; 4:11-12; 10:42-43; 13:16-41; 17:30-31; see Luke 24:25-27, 44-47). It also demonstrates that Christ brought salvation (8:35; 10:36; 16:17, 30-31), prayer advances God’s Kingdom (1:12-15; 2:1-4; 4:24-31; 12:5), and the Holy Spirit energizes and equips God’s people to carry out their mission (1:8; 4:8, 31; 6:3, 5, 10; 7:55; 11:24; 13:9, 52).\nActs shows the importance of the individuals that God chose to carry his message and testify about Christ. At the beginning the apostles—especially Peter—testified about the life and ministry of Jesus (1:22; 10:39-41; see Luke 1:2) and explained Jesus’ significance in God’s plan to redeem humanity (2:40; 3:15; 4:33; 10:42). Later, other Christian leaders shared in the task of testifying for their Lord; Stephen and Philip are two outstanding examples of bold witnesses for the faith (7:2-53; 8:4-40). Other Christians simply shared their faith as they had opportunity (e.g., 8:1-4; 11:19-21). Later, God called Paul to participate in this enterprise as his “chosen instrument to take [his] message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel” (9:15; 22:1-21; 26:2-23). Paul, like Peter, occupies a central role in Acts as a major witness for Christ.\nThe apostles proclaimed that the death and resurrection of Jesus was God’s plan in fulfillment of Scripture (2:22-36; 3:15; 4:27-28, 33; 7:52; 8:32-35; 10:38-43; 13:26-39). Jesus was the one appointed to redeem humankind, so the apostles’ message was, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved” (16:31). God offers his grace and forgiveness to all, and “there is peace with God through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all” (10:36).\nFinally, the book of Acts demonstrates that no opposition can prevent the Good News of Jesus Christ from spreading. The messengers of this good news faced imprisonment, physical harm, and even death. Nonetheless, the message spread from a small group gathered in a room in Jerusalem (1:12-14) to Jews and Gentiles spread across the Roman world. In fact, the book closes with Paul sharing the message freely at the epicenter of the known world (28:30-31).\nChronology of the Apostolic Age\nEvents in the apostolic age are difficult to date because few precise statements are made about time. Many events, however, can be correlated with known dates in the Roman world.\nEvents from AD 30 to 50.  We know from Roman sources that Herod Agrippa I died in AD 44 (Acts 12:23), so his execution of the apostle James and imprisonment of Peter (12:2-17) must have happened before that date.\nThe famine prophesied by Agabus befell Judea during the reign of Emperor Claudius (11:28-29). When the church in Antioch sent famine relief to the church in Jerusalem, Barnabas and Paul were appointed to carry the money (11:29-30). It was Paul’s second trip to Jerusalem after his conversion. The Jewish historian Josephus dates the famine between AD 46 and 48.\nWhile Paul was in Corinth on his second missionary journey, Gallio was governor of Achaia (18:12). An inscription discovered at nearby Delphi indicates that Gallio’s term was AD 51–52. The incident in 18:12-17 probably occurred at the beginning of Gallio’s term. Paul then left Corinth not long afterward, probably in the summer or autumn of AD 52. Paul had spent eighteen months in Corinth (18:11), so he probably arrived in early AD 50. That arrival date is confirmed by 18:2. When Paul came to Corinth, Aquila and Priscilla had recently been exiled from Rome. Claudius expelled Jews from Rome in AD 49.\nEvents from AD 50 to 70.  Festus replaced Felix as governor of Judea during Paul’s imprisonment in Caesarea (24:27), probably in the summer of AD 59. This event helps us date events in the rest of the book of Acts. Paul’s arrest (21:33) was about two years beforehand (AD 57). Earlier that spring, Paul had celebrated Passover in Philippi (20:6; April AD 57). Paul had just spent three months in Greece (20:3), probably the winter of AD 56–57 (see 1 Cor 16:6). Previously Paul had spent three years in Ephesus (Acts 20:31; AD 53–56).\nAfter Festus arrived in the summer of AD 59, Paul quickly stood trial and appealed to Caesar (25:1-12). The voyage to Rome most likely began in the fall of AD 59 (27:2) and ended early in AD 60 (28:11-16). Paul stayed in Rome “for the next two years” (28:30). The New Testament does not report the outcome of Paul’s trial, but he was probably released and then recaptured and martyred in Rome along with Peter and many others during Nero’s persecution (around AD 64–65).\nIn Jerusalem, James the brother of Jesus was stoned to death by the Jewish authorities in AD 62 (Josephus, Antiquities 20.9.1). Not long afterward, the church in Jerusalem left that doomed city and settled in Pella, one of the cities of the Decapolis east of the Jordan. Thus, when war broke out between the Jews and the Romans in AD 66, the Christians largely escaped its fury. The war ended in AD 70, when Jerusalem and the Temple were destroyed.\nEvents from AD 70 to 100.  The New Testament writers and other early Christians left few records of the period following the destruction of Jerusalem. It is possible that both Matthew and Luke wrote after AD 70, but they did not write about the developments that occurred after AD 70. Similarly, the apostle John probably wrote his Gospel and three letters close to AD 90, but we learn few specifics about the late first-century church from those writings. If Revelation was written in the early 90s AD, then it gives us a glimpse of what the churches in Asia Minor were facing during that time (see Revelation Book Introduction, “Date of Writing”).\nAs the apostolic age came to a close, the church around the Mediterranean grew and developed, as it would continue to do after the last of the apostles had died and the leadership of the church had passed on to the following generations.",

    "content": "Romans has been called the greatest theological document ever written. In this letter, the apostle Paul explains the Good News—the climactic revelation of God to the world through his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul reflects on the human condition, on the meaning of our lives on earth, and on our hope for the world to come. He constantly moves us back to the fundamentals of God’s truth revealed in Christ, and he teaches us to deal with the problems, failures, and disputes that characterize life in this world.\nSetting\nWe do not know who first brought the Good News to Rome. Perhaps Jews from Rome who were converted when God first poured out his Spirit on the day of Pentecost (see Acts 2:10) took the message back to their home city. Several “house churches” quickly grew up, made up primarily of converts from Judaism.\nIn AD 49, the Emperor Claudius expelled all Jews from Rome—including Jewish Christians (see Acts 18:2). Although Paul had never visited Rome (Rom 1:13), in his travels he met some of these Roman Christians, such as Priscilla and Aquila (Rom 16:3-4; cp. Acts 18:2).\nClaudius’s decree eventually lapsed, so by the time Paul wrote his letter to the Romans, many Jewish Christians had returned to Rome. However, in their absence, the Gentile Christians had taken the lead in the Christian community in Rome. Therefore, when Paul wrote to the Roman Christians (probably around AD 57), the Roman Christian community was divided into two major factions. The Gentile Christians now comprised the majority group, and they were naturally less concerned about continuity with the Old Testament or with the demands of the law of Moses than their Jewish brothers and sisters. They apparently even looked down on the Jewish Christians (see Rom 11:25). The minority Jewish Christians, for their part, reacted to the Gentile-Christian majority by insisting on adherence to certain aspects of the law of Moses. Paul wrote this letter to the Roman Christians to address this theological and social division, a schism that had at its heart the question of continuity and discontinuity between Jewish and Christian faith.\nSummary\nIn the introduction of the letter (1:1-17), Paul identifies himself and his readers (1:1-7), expresses thanks for the Roman Christians (1:8-15), and introduces the theme of the letter: the “Good News about Christ” (1:16-17).\nBefore elaborating on this Good News, Paul sets out the dark backdrop of universal human sinfulness that makes the Good News necessary. Both Gentiles (1:18-32) and Jews (2:1–3:8) have turned away from God’s revelation of himself. All are “under the power of sinunder sin” and cannot be made right with God by anything they do (3:9-20).\nInto this hopeless situation comes the Good News, which reveals a new “way to be made right” with God. God provided this new way by sending Jesus as a sacrifice for sin, and all human beings can gain the benefits of that sacrifice by faith (3:21-26). In 3:27–4:25, Paul highlights the nature and centrality of faith. He shows that faith excludes boasting and that it enables both Jews and Gentiles to have equal access to God’s grace in Christ (3:27-31). He develops these same points through reference to Abraham (4).\nIn chs 5–8, Paul discusses the assurance or  security of salvation. The assurance that believers will share God’s glory (5:1-11) is based on the way in which Jesus Christ more than reversed the terrible effects of Adam’s sin (5:12-21). Neither sin (ch 6) nor the law (ch 7) can prevent God from accomplishing his purposes for the believer. The Holy Spirit liberates believers from death (8:1-17) and assures them that the sufferings of this life will not keep them from the glory to which God has destined them (8:18-39).\nThe Good News can only truly be “good news” if the message of Christ stands in continuity with God’s promises in the Old Testament. But the unbelief of so many Jews might seem to show that God’s promises to Israel are not being fulfilled (9:1-5). So, in chs 9–11, Paul demonstrates that God is being faithful to his promises. God had never promised salvation to all Jews, but only to a remnant (9:6-29). The Jews themselves are responsible for their predicament because they refuse to recognize the fulfillment of God’s promises in Christ (9:30–10:21). Nonetheless, God is faithfully preserving a remnant of Jewish believers (11:1-10), and God has still more to accomplish for his people Israel (11:11-36).\nThe Good News rescues people from the penalty of sin, and it also transforms a person’s life. In 12:1–15:13, Paul turns his attention to the transforming power of the Good News. This transformation demands a whole new way of thinking and living (12:1-2). The transformed life will be fleshed out in community harmony (12:3-8), manifestations of love (12:9-21; cp. 13:8-10), and submission to the government (13:1-7). The transformed life derives its power from the work God has already done and finds its urgency in the work he has yet to do (13:11-14).\nIn 14:1–15:13, Paul tackles a specific issue that was a problem in the church at Rome. Christians were criticizing each other over various practices related to the Old Testament law. Paul exhorts them to accept each other and to look to Christ’s example of self-giving love as the model to emulate.\nThe letter format of Romans emerges again at the end, where Paul touches on his ministry and travel plans (15:14-33), greets and commends fellow workers and other Christians (16:1-16), and concludes with further references to fellow workers, a final warning, and a doxology (16:17-27).\nDate, Place, and Occasion of Writing\nPaul probably wrote Romans during a three-month stay in Corinth near the end of his third missionary journey (Acts 20:2-3), around AD 57. The reference to Cenchrea in Romans 16:1—a port city next to Corinth—identifies the geography more precisely. By this time, Paul had completed his missionary work in the eastern Mediterranean, and his visit to Jerusalem was imminent.\nWe can determine the general situation in which Romans was written by reviewing Paul’s references to his prior ministry and his future travel plans (15:14-33). Four geographical references provide the framework: (1) Looking back, Paul declared that he had “fully presented the Good News of Christ from Jerusalem all the way to Illyricum” (15:19). Illyricum was a Roman province that occupied the same general area as modern-day Serbia and Croatia. Paul noted that he had planted churches in major cities from Jerusalem, through Asia Minor, and into Macedonia and Greece. This was the territory Paul and his companions covered on the three great missionary journeys recorded in Acts. (2) Paul’s intermediate destination was Jerusalem, where he planned to deliver a “gift to the believers” (15:25). This gift was money that Paul had been collecting from the Gentile churches he had founded to assist the church in Jerusalem (15:26; see also 1 Cor 16:1-4; 2 Cor 8:1–9:15). (3) After visiting Jerusalem to deliver the collection, Paul planned to go to Rome (Rom 15:24). (4) A long stay with the Roman Christians was not Paul’s final goal, as the language of 15:24 (“stop off”) makes clear. His ultimate goal was Spain, where he could pursue his calling to plant churches in places “where the name of Christ has never been heard” (15:20, 24). This information points to a date near the end of the third missionary journey.\nPaul’s Purpose in Writing\nRomans combines three specific purposes: to summarize Paul’s theology, to solicit support for a future mission to Spain, and to bring unity to the church in Rome.\nPaul was at a critical juncture in his ministry (15:20). He had “fully presented” the Good News to the eastern Mediterranean basin (15:19). He now stood ready to preach the Good News in new territory. It is quite natural, then, that Paul took the occasion of his letter to the Romans to summarize his theology as he had hammered it out in the midst of controversy and trial for the previous twenty-five years.\nEven so, summarizing theology is not Paul’s whole purpose in writing—Paul says little about certain key theological ideas (e.g., the person of Christ, the church, the last days). Nor does this purpose explain why Paul would have sent such a summary to the church in Rome specifically.\nAnother purpose then emerges: Paul wanted to gather support from the Roman Christians for his new mission in Spain. Paul’s “sending church,” Antioch, was thousands of miles from Spain. As the apostle sought a new church to partner with him, his attention naturally turned to the church in Rome (15:24). Therefore, it is likely that Paul sent this dense theological treatise to Rome because he wanted to explain who he was and what he believed. Because Paul’s message had been frequently misunderstood, he became a controversial figure in the early church. He was undoubtedly aware that some Christians in Rome were suspicious of him and that he therefore must provide a careful and reasoned defense of his position on some of the most debated issues of the faith.\nPaul also wrote for a third reason: to heal a rift in the Christian community in Rome, which was divided over the degree to which the Old Testament law should continue to guide believers (see 14:1–15:13).\nMeaning and Message\nIn Romans, Paul presented the Good News as he had come to understand it. The heart of that Good News is the offer of salvation in Christ for all who believe. Paul explores the problem of human sin, the solution provided in the cross of Christ, and the assurance of glory that a living relationship with Christ provides. The message of the cross of Christ stands both in continuity with the Old Testament (because its promises are truly fulfilled in Christ) and in discontinuity with it (as God in Christ inaugurates a new covenant that transcends the Old Testament law).\nInterpretation\nSince the time of the Reformation, Romans has been read as a letter about the salvation of the individual. Following the lead of Martin Luther, whose own spiritual pilgrimage was closely tied to Romans, the Reformers (such as John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli) saw in this letter the classic biblical expression of the truth that human beings are made right with God by their faith in Christ and not by their own effort. The Reformers viewed Paul as fighting against a legalistic Judaism that insisted that people had to obey the law to be saved. Jewish preoccupation with the law had led many Jews to presume that faithfulness to the law was sufficient for salvation (e.g., 10:1-4).\nMany contemporary interpreters insist that this Reformation perspective left out important elements in understanding both the letter itself and first-century Judaism. Jews in Paul’s day, it is argued, did not believe that they had to obey the law to be saved. They were already saved, through God’s choosing them to be his people. Obeying the law was the way they maintained their status as God’s people. These interpreters say that Paul was not fighting against legalism but against exclusivism—against the Jewish claim that salvation was confined to Israel and was not to be shared with Gentiles. Accordingly, Paul shows how the Good News relates salvation through faith to the continuity of God’s people from the Old Testament to the New Testament and to the relationship of Jews and Gentiles in his own day.\nThis new approach to understanding Romans has much to commend it. Christian interpreters have sometimes missed the notes of grace and faith that are part of Jewish teaching. And Romans does have a lot to say about including Gentiles in God’s people and the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in the church.\nUltimately, however, neither the Reformation view nor the contemporary view alone explains everything in Romans. These views need to be combined if we are to appreciate the letter as a whole. At its most foundational level, Romans is about the Good News—and the Good News, first and foremost, is a message about how everyone can have a right relationship with God.",

    "content": "In this fascinating letter to a multiethnic church, we see some of the everyday problems the early Christians were dealing with. In Paul’s advice on how to handle these problems, we find deep principles that shape his thinking about practical Christian living. These enduring principles—so different from the popular trends of Paul’s time or ours—provide rich guidance for us as we deal with similar problems today.\nSetting\nCorinth’s widespread reputation as an important city full of vice was linked to its geography. The city was strategically located on the narrow four- to five-mile-wide isthmus separating mainland Greece from the Peloponnesus (the large southern peninsula). It profited from travelers passing north and south along the main overland route and from those sailing east and west between the Gulf of Corinth and the Saronic Gulf. To avoid the stormy hazards of the Mediterranean Sea, especially in wintertime, the owners of small commercial boats sailing between Italy and the eastern Mediterranean often had their boats dragged over the isthmus from one gulf to the other and spent a night or two in Corinth on the way. As a result, Corinth gained the notoriety of a port city and was widely known for prostitution and other vices. There was even a verb in Greek (korinthiazomai, “to act like a Corinthian”) that referred to sexual immorality. It’s not surprising that some of these problems made their way into the young church (see Paul’s strong words about sexual immorality in 5:1-13; 6:12-20).\nOld Corinth was conquered and destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC. It was rebuilt a century later as a Roman colony and populated in large part by former Roman slaves. By the time of Paul’s visit, it was a cosmopolitan city, with Romans, Greeks, Jews, and other ethnic groups from all over the Mediterranean, as well as international visitors passing through the city. As a result, the members of the young church were multiethnic, which was likely a factor in the tensions it experienced (see Paul’s rebuke of their cliquishness in 1:10-12; 3:1-4).\nPaul first arrived in the city during his second missionary trip (around AD 50), after his work in the northern province of Macedonia and in Athens. Realizing that the city was strategic to his evangelistic efforts, he stayed in Corinth for eighteen months (AD 50–52; see Acts 18:1-17). When the Jews took him to court for breaking the law, the governor Gallio threw the case out because it was a religious dispute. Given the freedom to evangelize, Paul made a number of converts and began a church there before he left.\nOver the next five years, Paul corresponded with the Corinthians several times on difficult issues and even visited them personally to sort out some of their problems. The present letter, written during the period AD 53–56, was sent from Ephesus, in the province of Asia (western Turkey), where Paul spent two to three years on his third missionary journey.\nSummary\nPaul deals with a wide range of problems and questions facing the young church—some of which reflect the problems of the city itself—and he gives specific advice on dealing with them. Paul’s advice reflects the fundamental principles underlying his view of the Christian life, principles rooted in the Good News itself. Paul addressed the following issues:\n•Criticism of Paul’s non-intellectual approach to evangelism (1:1–4:21)\n•A flagrant case of sexual immorality in the church (5:1-13)\n•The practice of taking fellow believers to court before pagan judges (6:1-20)\n•Problems of sexual immorality (6:1-20)\n•Questions about marriage, divorce, and staying single (7:1-40)\n•The question of whether believers are allowed to eat meat sacrificed to pagan idols (8:1–10:33)\n•The question of appropriate dress for women who minister publicly (11:1-34)\n•Irreverent and disrespectful behavior in receiving the Lord’s Supper (11:1-34)\n•Distorted perspectives on spiritual gifts and their practice (12:1–14:40)\n•Skepticism about a future resurrection of the dead (15:1-58)\nAuthorship\nPaul is widely accepted as the writer of 1 Corinthians. Some, however, question the authenticity of 14:34-35 (see study note there). In line with common practice of the ancient world, Paul used an amanuensis (secretary) to do the actual writing of the letter (see 16:21).\nDate and Occasion of Writing\nThis letter to the Corinthian church was written on Paul’s third missionary journey, during his two- to three-year stay in Ephesus (around AD 53–56; see Acts 19:1-41). Paul had written a previous letter to the church in Corinth (see 1 Cor 5:9), and the Corinthians had replied, asking his advice on a number of points (see, e.g., 7:1). He had also received reports and visitors from Corinth (see 1:11; 16:15-17), making him aware of a number of problems facing the young church. This letter, full of advice on specific issues, is his response. It may have been delivered by Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus (see 16:15-17) when they returned to Corinth.\nSome problems apparently remained unresolved, resulting in a later personal visit to Corinth and a strongly worded letter that we do not have. Paul refers to these in the emotionally laden letter we know as 2 Corinthians, written from Macedonia shortly after he left Ephesus, in anticipation of yet another visit to the church (see 2 Cor 2:1-11; 7:8-10; 2 Corinthians Book Introduction, “Date and Occasion of Writing”).\nMeaning and Message\nIn 1 Corinthians, we catch a fascinating glimpse of what life was like in the early church. We see some of the practical problems the early Christians faced as they lived in a pagan environment and how they dealt with them.\nMotivation for Christian Behavior.  Paul deals with problems in the churches from a thoroughly Christian point of view, rooted in the Good News of God’s grace. In his thinking, Christian behavior is firmly grounded in Christian theology, in the message of Christ and the cross. The advice he gives on Christian living is not simply pragmatic, but solidly based on the relationship of believers to Christ. His own practical life has been revolutionized by his experience of God’s grace in Christ.\nSo, for example, when Paul addresses issues of sexual morality (5:1–6:20), he reminds the church that believers have been made new by the sacrifice of Christ and that they should live accordingly. His appeal for faithfulness is not that they should keep the law of Moses, but that they should understand what it means to be united to Christ and to be the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit (6:15-20).\nWhen Paul discourages believers from taking one another to pagan law courts (6:1-8), he is in part concerned for the effect on their witness as Christians. He urges them to give up their rights out of love for others, as Christ did. The death of Christ has taught him that Christian love is sacrificial.\nWhen Paul gives advice on marriage (7:1-40), he encourages those who are unmarried in that context to remain single so they can give themselves more fully to Christ’s service. Christians are claimed by Christ and can no longer live only for themselves.\nWhen he addresses the freedom of believers to eat meat sacrificed to pagan idols (8:1-13; 10:1–11:1), he avoids formulating rules, asserting their liberty in Christ to eat anything. He emphasizes, however, that the effect of one’s actions on others is always more important than one’s own rights, so believers should readily abstain from actions that would be detrimental to others. Like Christ, they are to be governed by sacrificial love in all their relationships.\nIn Paul’s thinking, Christian behavior is a response of gratitude to the mercy and grace of God, shown in Christ and expressed in the Good News. The whole of the believer’s life is to express devotion to God and love for others (see 10:31-33). This is Paul’s equivalent to Jesus’ two great love commands (Matt 22:36-40; Luke 10:25-37). In this letter, we see more clearly than elsewhere how Paul applies these enduring principles to a wide range of practical problems.\nPaul’s Understanding of Evangelism.  When Paul is criticized for his rather unpolished, non-intellectual approach to evangelism (1 Cor 1:1–4:21), he emphasizes that only God can change a person’s heart. The real power does not lie in the persuasive powers of human intellect and rhetoric, but in the message of God’s grace and in the power of God’s Spirit to renew and transform. Conversion is not a matter of one person changing another person’s mind, but of God changing a person’s heart.\nUnity and Love in the Church.  Unity among believers is an important theme throughout this letter, as a number of the issues Paul deals with have apparently divided the church (see 1:10–4:21, cliques in the church; 6:1-12, lawsuits against fellow Christians; 8:1–11:1, different opinions on food sacrificed to idols; 11:2-16, different opinions on appropriate dress for women ministering publicly; 11:17-34, problems in taking the Lord’s Supper). Bound together as fellow members of Christ’s body by a common commitment to Christ as Lord and by the shared experience of God’s Spirit, believers are to live together in unity. This letter, which includes Paul’s classic chapter on Christian love (ch 13), highlights the importance of relating to other believers in sacrificial love, the kind of love shown by Christ himself.\nMarriage, Divorce, and the Single Life.  Paul has a high view of marriage and strongly opposes divorce. In light of the difficult environment for Christians in the first century and his view of the imminent return of Christ (see 7:25-31), Paul encourages those who are single to remain so, seeing singleness as an opportunity to give full devotion to Christ’s work in the world (see 7:32-35). The two ways of living (married and celibate) are not ends in themselves, but alternate ways of participating in the more important purpose of serving Christ.\nThe Lord’s Supper.  This letter sheds significant light on early Christian understanding and practice of the Lord’s Supper, offering the only extended treatment in the New Testament (chs 10–11).\nThe Church As a Body.  Paul understands the church as a dynamic, Spirit-led body made up of different parts, each with its own unique work to do (chs 12, 14). In these early days of the Christian movement, there is no distinction between clergy and laity, but the different roles create a complementary ministry of the Spirit’s gifts when Christians gather. Each person has a part to play in building up the body, and individuals are dependent on the Spirit to empower and guide them in their ministries.\nThe Resurrection.  Among the New Testament writings, this letter gives us the most complete discussion of resurrection (ch 15), including the fullest account of those who saw the resurrected Jesus, the rationale for a future resurrection, and the nature of resurrection bodies.",

    "content": "Second Corinthians shows Paul as a pastor. He passionately desires to win the Christians in Corinth back to himself, convinced that the Good News is above all a message of reconciliation. Paul faced criticism and accusations from fellow Christians who doubted him as a leader. Forced to defend himself, he opens his heart to this congregation to a degree not found in his other letters. Paul faced many dangers, including threats to his life, but being falsely accused by Christians he had won for Christ was one of his worst trials. Paul’s example, demonstrating how Christ loves his church, is a great source of encouragement and hope to Christian leaders and to their congregations.\nSetting\nThe apostle Paul first came to Corinth in the course of his second missionary journey (see Acts 18:1-20). The city was ancient even in Paul’s day. It had developed into a strong, well-populated economic and urban center from the 500s BC. Under Roman occupation and influence since Julius Caesar reestablished it in 44 BC, it became a city of fine buildings, shops, theaters, and houses. Its trade brought much wealth, and the city prospered. Artisans crafted bronze artifacts, pottery, and especially the terra cotta lamps that were well-known throughout the ancient world (see 2 Cor 4:7). Agriculture was also key to Corinth’s prosperity (see 9:6-10; 1 Cor 3:6-9; 9:7, 10). Beginning in 27 BC, Achaia (southern Greece) came under the control of the Roman senate because of Corinth’s economic importance and geographical advantage.\nThe religious life of Corinth is well attested in contemporary writings. The Greek goddess Aphrodite (whom the Romans called Venus)—the goddess of life, beauty, and passion—was a popular deity. Strabo speaks of her vast temple on a hill above the city as a center of prostitution, and the moral climate of Corinth was infamously degraded. Scholars are now cautious about this opinion, since the political rivalry between Corinth and nearby Athens might have motivated Strabo’s denigrating remarks about Corinth. However, we know that Paul wrote Rom 1:18-32 while he was at Corinth (see Romans Book Introduction, “Date, Place, and Occasion of Writing”; cp. Acts 20:2-3), and 2 Corinthians undeniably reflects his awareness of serious moral problems there (see 2 Cor 6:14-17; 12:19-21).\nInto this city Paul brought the message of Christ. By God’s grace and the ministry of his servant, a company of believers was established, and the nascent church grew. Paul’s converts, whom he regarded as his children (6:13; 12:14; 1 Cor 4:15), were a mixed lot, a cross-section of cosmopolitan society in this city that was famous for its pretensions to wisdom and rhetoric, its popular culture, its trade, its two harbors, and its love of life. At the climax of his list of trials in 2 Corinthians 11:23-28, Paul writes: “Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches.” No congregation seemed to bring Paul more concern than the church at Corinth.\nSummary\nThis letter arises out of challenges to Paul’s apostolic authority and the infiltration of false teachers. So, in the first half of 2 Corinthians (chs 1–6), Paul outlines his understanding of Christian service. Suffering for Christ’s sake is a necessary part of service (1:1-24), though it is hard to endure when we are offended by fellow Christians (2:1-17). The message of Good News gives life in the Spirit and God’s salvation, replacing the religion of the old covenant, though it has continuity with it (3:1-18). The power of the message shows through the weakness of God’s servants (4:1-18) and centers in the death of God’s Son, by which we are restored to God’s favor (5:1-21). Christian living is marked by devotion and dedication that distinguish believers from the evils of the world (6:1-18).\nIn the second half of the letter (chs 7–13), Paul explains how he came to write his letters to Corinth (7:1-16), reveals principles of giving and stewardship in discussing the collection for the Jerusalem church (8:1–9:15), and makes a spirited defense of his apostolic work against those who denigrated his status because of his weaknesses (chs 10–13).\nAuthor\nNo one has seriously challenged Paul’s authorship of 2 Corinthians. The sole exception is that 6:14–7:1 is sometimes regarded as a non-Pauline insertion, perhaps from a sect, since it is similar in terminology to the Dead Sea Scrolls. More likely it is simply a digression, or perhaps it has been taken from another of Paul’s letters to Corinth and inserted here. Either way, the material in it was most likely written by Paul himself to deal with the moral and spiritual situation in the church at Corinth.\nDate and Occasion of Writing\nDuring his two- to three-year stay in Ephesus (AD 53~56), Paul wrote 1 Corinthians and sent it to the church in Corinth by the hand of Timothy (see 1 Cor 16:10-11; 1 Corinthians Book Introduction, “Date and Occasion of Writing”). Apparently 1 Corinthians was not well-received, and some of the Corinthians were now questioning Paul’s apostolic authority. This crisis was anticipated in 1 Cor 4:18-21, but the challenge became more vocal and aggressive. So Paul made a personal visit from Ephesus (2 Cor 2:1). This visit apparently failed to achieve its purpose, as Paul’s opponents apparently withstood him. Humiliated before the church and insulted by a prominent member, Paul returned to Ephesus in great distress. He then wrote a “severe letter” and sent it with Titus to Corinth (2:3-13). This severe letter, which has been lost, was successful in finally bringing the Corinthians to repentance (7:8-10).\nMeanwhile, Paul left Ephesus after severe trials (Acts 19:23-41; cp. 1:8-11; 4:8-15; 6:4-10) and traveled to Macedonia (Acts 20:1). In Macedonia Paul found Titus, who had arrived from Corinth, and Titus gave Paul a very encouraging report about the situation there (2 Cor 7:5-7). In response to that report, Paul wrote 2 Corinthians (around AD 56) and sent it back to Corinth with Titus (8:6, 16-19). Paul then traveled on to Corinth himself, where he spent three months (see Acts 20:1-3).\nThe Unity of 2 Corinthians as a Letter\nAlthough there is no question that Paul himself wrote 2 Corinthians, there are questions about whether it was all written and sent as one letter.\n2 Cor 6:14–7:1. In 1 Corinthians 5:9, Paul mentions a letter that he had previously sent to Corinth dealing with the issue of associating with immoral people. Although this letter has been lost, some scholars believe that at least part of it is preserved as 2 Corinthians 6:14–7:1, which addresses the same subject. If 6:14–7:1 is a fragment of that previous letter, it might explain why this section seems to be inserted in the discussion, which would otherwise flow naturally from 6:13 directly to 7:2. On the other hand, Paul often digressed while writing his letters, so it is also possible that 6:14–7:1 is simply a digression.\n2 Cor 10:1–13:14. The last four chapters of 2 Corinthians are a puzzle. The tone of these chapters is indignant and ironic. Some see them as part of Paul’s “severe letter” (see 7:8); but that is not likely, since the Corinthians responded to his severe letter with repentance (7:9). It makes more sense to regard chapters 10–13 as being written later than chapters 1–9 in response to a new situation that arose following the coming of false teachers to Corinth (cp. 11:4, 12-15). The Corinthians had warmly received these teachers, who quickly reopened old wounds and insinuated that Paul was not a true apostle nor even a Christian at all (see 10:7, 10; 11:5; 12:11). When Paul sensed the danger, he wrote a blistering note full of irony, invective, ridicule, and self-defense. At the heart of chapters 10–13 is Paul’s “Fool’s Speech” (11:16–12:10), in which he resorts to boasting because the need compels him (11:1, 16-17).\nWe cannot tell whether the words preserved in chapters 10–13 succeeded in warding off these threats and defending once more Paul’s apostolic standing in Corinth. Paul followed up this letter with a visit (Acts 20:2) as he came to Greece, presumably Corinth. He eventually sailed to Jerusalem with the money donated by the churches, including Corinth. So it is possible that Paul’s last letter was the most effective of all, and the Corinthians were finally won over. Forty years after the Corinthian correspondence, a letter known as 1 Clement, written by a leader at Rome to the Corinthians, speaks warmly of Paul’s ministry.\nMeaning and Message\nSecond Corinthians is a very human document that opens a window onto the inner life of the apostle Paul. For that reason, it has been called Paul’s most personal letter.\nThe Minister’s Job Description.  The first half of the letter (1:1–7:16) explains and describes the responsibilities and privileges of a leader. The message of Good News is new (3:1-18) and must be validated by the lifestyle of those who proclaim it. And the Good News brings reconciliation (5:1-21).\nThe Heart of the Good News.  Chapter 5 contains one of the fullest accounts of Paul’s central message (5:18-21). Paul had already told the Corinthians that he came preaching Christ crucified (1 Cor 1:18–2:2). Now he explains how this message is to be applied in light of the current situation: People are out of harmony with God because of sin, so God has acted in response to human need. God in Christ has dealt with the problem of sin and alienation by becoming human and taking our sin upon himself at the cross. Through Christ, we are restored to a relationship of peace and acceptance with God. We are urged to be reconciled to God (2 Cor 5:20) and to maintain our reconciliation with God. This relationship needs to be maintained throughout our lives, which implies loyalty to the Good News as Paul proclaimed it and separation from moral evils such as those that plagued the city of Corinth.\nThe Call to Holy Living.  Running through this letter is a summons to holy life. The two governing images are of the church as a temple (6:14–7:1) and as a bride (11:2). Both images speak of purity and dedication. The Temple is the holy place where God is worshiped, so his people should be consecrated to this task. The bride of Christ should be faithful to her husband.\nThe Need for Generous Giving.  Two lengthy chapters (8:1–9:15) are devoted to this single theme. Those who are at strife in Corinth need to consider the needs of others, especially the poverty-stricken Jewish believers in Jerusalem. The incarnate Lord Jesus Christ is our supreme model for sacrificial giving (8:9).\n What was at stake at Corinth was the essence of the Good News as expressed in the way of the cross. Paul’s experience of suffering and weakness as an apostle was, to the believers in Corinth, a seeming contradiction to his authority. In fact, however, the essence of the Good News is for people to accept another person’s (Christ’s) suffering on their behalf. This is still relevant to leadership and daily living among Christians today.",

    "content": "Is a person saved by faith alone, or by a combination of faith plus works? Paul’s letter to the Galatians proclaims that salvation is through faith alone. It also emphasizes freedom in Christ to live by the power of the Spirit, knowing that our relationship with God is not based on our performance but on the finished work of Jesus Christ. So we are truly free, not to serve our sinful nature, but to love and serve our Lord and others.\nSetting\nWhen Paul and Barnabas set out from Antioch of Syria on their first missionary journey, they headed across the northeast corner of the Mediterranean Sea through Cyprus, across the Taurus Mountains of Pamphylia, and into the south of the Roman province of Galatia. There Paul and Barnabas established churches in Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe (Acts 13:13–14:28). Many believed the Good News, but the message also aroused opposition and persecution. Paul and Barnabas then returned to Antioch of Syria, reporting on what God had accomplished “and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles, too” (Acts 14:27).\nFrom the results of Paul’s ministry in Galatia and from Peter’s experience with Cornelius and his household in Caesarea (see Acts 10:1-48), it became clear that salvation was available to Gentiles as well as Jews on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ. Gentiles did not have to become Jews in order to become full members of God’s family. They had only to put their faith in Jesus Christ for salvation.\nEven so, in the period before the council in Jerusalem (AD 49 or 50; Acts 15:1-41), controversy over the relationship of Jews and Gentiles in the church became more heated. When Peter returned to Jerusalem from his groundbreaking work among Gentiles in Caesarea, he faced immediate criticism and pressure from Jewish compatriots who opposed his eating with uncircumcised Gentiles. He answered with an account of the Spirit’s work, which temporarily stilled the criticism (Acts 11:1-18).\nSome Jewish Christians continued to believe that Gentiles should practice Judaism in order to be Christians. Those who believed this are often referred to as “Judaizers.” Some of these Judaizers went to Galatia and began claiming that Paul’s teaching about the Good News was inadequate. They denigrated Paul’s status as an apostle, declaring that he had learned the Good News from the “real” apostles in Jerusalem. They asserted that Paul had changed the message, and that his version of the gospel had never received the apostles’ sanction. The Judaizers argued that Paul’s law-free gospel was incomplete, and they claimed that the real gospel required Gentiles to be circumcised and to keep other aspects of the law. Largely in response to the challenge brought by the Judaizers, Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians.\nSummary\nAfter briefly identifying himself and greeting his recipients (Gal 1:1-5), Paul launches directly into his thesis: The Good News that he preaches is the only true Good News (1:6-7), he is a genuine apostle of Christ (1:1, 10), and his opponents will suffer God’s judgment for their false message (1:8-9). The rest of the letter centers around these assertions.\nPaul first demonstrates that he is a genuine apostle of Christ, preaching the true Good News (1:11–2:21). To this end, Paul reminds the Galatians of the kind of person he used to be (1:13-14) and recounts his conversion experience and his calling by God (1:15-16a). Paul received the Good News as a direct revelation from Christ (1:11-12) rather than from the other apostles in Jerusalem (1:16-24). Still, the other apostles recognized Paul’s apostleship and message (2:1-10), and they had nothing to add or change. Further, Paul displayed his genuineness in an instance when Peter and some others compromised the Good News contrary to their own principles (2:11-21).\nPaul then makes an argument that his presentation of the Good News is scriptural and true (3:1–5:12). The Galatians had experienced the Spirit by faith (3:1-5), so they—like all who have faith in Christ—would experience the same blessing that Abraham received (3:6-9). By contrast, trying to be righteous by keeping the law only brings a curse (3:10-12). Christ rescued us from that curse and made God’s blessing available to all who have faith in him (3:13-14). God’s promise to Abraham shows that the promise is given on the basis of faith, not law (3:15-18). God’s demand for righteousness was fulfilled by Christ, not by keeping the law, and those who have faith in Christ become recipients of God’s promise to Abraham.\nThe law’s purpose is not to make people righteous or to make them recipients of God’s promises. Instead, it brings awareness of sin and points to Christ and faith in him (3:19-22). Now that Christ has come, those who have faith in him are God’s children and heirs of his promises (3:23–4:7). In light of this, the Galatians’ return to trusting in the law was a dreadful return to slavery (4:8-11), so Paul personally appeals to them to reconsider (4:12-20). He draws an analogy between Hagar and Sarah and the old and new covenants, showing that Christ brings freedom, not slavery (4:21-31). God’s people must live in freedom (5:1), reject a reliance on obedience to the law for salvation (5:2-4), and live by faith (5:5-6), because a message of salvation through the law is not from God (5:7-12).\nFinally, Paul shows the Galatians that Christian freedom is not a license to sin, as some might claim. Instead, it is the only way to overcome sin, to live in Christ’s love, and to experience the Spirit’s power (5:13–6:10). Freedom provides an opportunity to love rather than to sin (5:13-15), and the only way to overcome sin is to live by the power of the Holy Spirit (5:16-18). Living by human effort cannot overcome sin, because the sinful nature can produce only sinful actions (5:19-21). By contrast, living in the power of the Holy Spirit produces good fruit (5:22-23). Paul gives several examples of the Spirit’s leading in the lives of God’s children (5:24–6:10).\nPaul ends his letter with a postscript in his own hand (6:11-18). He appeals again to the cross of Christ, reiterates his central message, bestows God’s mercy and peace on those who follow his teaching, reasserts his apostolic authority, and closes with a benediction that extends “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ” to the recipients of his letter.\nAuthor\nGalatians has always been recognized as a genuine letter of Paul. It harmonizes well with the account of Paul’s mission in Acts and the other letters, and it authentically reflects Paul’s conflict with Jewish Christians who sought to make keeping the Jewish law a necessary element of Christian faith for Gentiles. Galatians has a message similar to that of Romans, but as an earlier letter, Galatians gives us a glimpse at the early stages of this intense, personal conflict. Here we feel the heartbeat of Paul’s care for the church.\nRecipients\nSome biblical scholars believe that Paul wrote to an ethnic group called “Galatians,” who lived in north central Asia Minor and were related to Gauls and Celts. Others believe that the recipients of Paul’s letter were groups of churches within the Roman province of Galatia, a much larger area than ethnic Galatia. The Roman province included in its southern districts a number of cities that Paul visited on his first missionary journey (Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe).\nPaul does not seem to have spent extended time in ethnic Galatia to the north (see possible references in Acts 16:6; 18:23), whereas we do have record of extensive and repeated missionary activity by Paul in the southern part of the Roman province of Galatia (Acts 13:13–14:25; 16:1-5). The available evidence suggests that the Galatians to whom Paul wrote this letter were most likely those whom Paul evangelized on his first missionary journey.\nDate\nPaul wrote Galatians either shortly before the council at Jerusalem (Acts 15:1-29) in AD 49 or 50, or sometime after the council, perhaps during his third missionary journey (AD 53–57).\nTraditionally, scholars saw 2:1-10 as Paul’s description of the council at Jerusalem. However, close examination reveals serious differences between ch 2 and Acts 15:1-41. It is hard to reconcile Paul’s account of two visits to Jerusalem (2:1) with the fact that the council in Acts 15:1-41 was really his third visit. Neglecting to mention his second visit (Acts 11:30; 12:25) would seriously weaken Paul’s argument that he had minimal contact with the apostles in Jerusalem. Furthermore, if this letter were written after the council, it would be hard to imagine why Paul doesn’t mention the council’s decision, which directly addresses the issue in Galatians. After the council, in fact, Paul gladly carried news of its decision to the churches he visited (Acts 16:4). It is thus difficult to believe that Galatians 2:1-10 describes Acts 15:1-41 and that Galatians was written after the council at Jerusalem.\nBy contrast, there are relatively few difficulties in identifying the occasion described in Galatians 2:1-10 with Acts 11:30 and 12:25. This would suggest that Paul wrote Galatians shortly before the council, perhaps in AD 48 or 49, right at the time when the controversy over circumcision was escalating in the church (see Acts 15:1-2).\nMeaning and Message\nThe problem that arose in Galatia was a familiar one in the first-century church, and it remains a problem in the church today. Are we truly saved by the work of Jesus Christ on the cross, or is something more necessary on our part?\nPaul’s letter to the Galatians establishes the completeness of the Good News—that salvation is available to all purely by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and not by observing the law. It also establishes the unity of God’s people: No division exists between Jews and Gentiles or between other classes of people. We all come to God and gain new life by the same means: through faith in Christ. Galatians establishes our liberty in Christ: We fulfill Christ’s law not by human effort but by living in faith and love by the Holy Spirit. Finally, the letter establishes our need for the grace of God, which rescues us from the curse of sin, gives us new life and the promised Holy Spirit, and makes us God’s children, empowered to fulfill Christ’s law of love.",

    "content": "Paul is taken up with the overwhelming goodness that God in Christ has showered on believers, and with his amazing plan to unite Gentiles with Jews in a new community—the church, the body of Christ. Here, Paul provides one of the finest descriptions of the Christian life in the entire New Testament. Though written from prison, this letter is full of joy, praise, and thanksgiving. It is a fitting reply to the wonder of God’s amazing grace in Christ, poured out in abundance on those chosen to know his love—Gentiles as well as Jews.\nSetting\nPaul’s third missionary journey (AD 53–57) centered on Ephesus, capital and port city of the Roman province of Asia on the western coast of what we now call Turkey. In Paul’s time, Ephesus was the fourth-largest city in the Roman empire, with a population of perhaps 500,000. Many people visited the city to see the famous temple of Artemis.\nAfter an initial brief visit (see Acts 18:19-21), Paul returned to spend between two and three years in this large and flourishing city (see Acts 19:1–20:1). It was a difficult time for him: He encountered much opposition and suffered much abuse (see Acts 19:21-41; 1 Cor 15:32; 2 Cor 1:8-9; 11:23-27). But during this time, people all over the province heard the Good News of Christ for the first time, and many small groups of believers sprang up, meeting together in homes, in villages and towns across the province (the seven churches addressed in Revelation probably originated during this time). Some of these churches (at Colosse, for example) were begun by Paul’s converts and had no firsthand acquaintance with Paul.\nIt is not clear how accurate these churches’ understanding of the gospel was, but we know from Paul’s letter to the Colossians that some of them had encountered false teaching and distorted perceptions. In Ephesians, Paul is concerned with a perception that Gentile Christians were inferior to or distinct from Jewish Christians, and not fully part of God’s “new Israel.” What gave rise to this misunderstanding is not clear—discrimination by Jewish Christians? Gentile aversion to Jewish Christians?—but it reflects traditional ethnic tensions between Jews and Gentiles throughout the Roman world. Paul was also concerned with a lack of awareness that God’s people are to live in a distinctly different way from the surrounding world.\nPaul writes a letter from prison that seems to be intended for several of these churches full of new converts. As their spiritual father, and as one commissioned by God to carry the Good News to the Gentiles, Paul was deeply concerned that these new believers have a correct understanding of all that God had given them in Christ and of the kind of life God wanted them to live in response.\nSummary\nWith a heart full of praise for all that God has done, Paul beautifully summarizes the Good News of God’s saving grace in Jesus Christ—emphasizing that it is for Gentiles as well as for Jews (chs 1–3). He also gives practical instructions on how believers are to live in response, turning away from their former lives to become truly good and like Christ (chs 4–6).\nFollowing a brief introduction (1:1-2), Paul praises God for the amazing grace that believers have received in Christ (1:3-14). In his sovereign love, God has chosen them, forgiven them, brought them into his family, made them his children, and promised them eternal blessings. In giving them his Spirit, he has marked them as his own so that they might praise his grace forever. Paul then prays that God will give them spiritual understanding to grasp the full depth of all that he has done for them (1:15-23). Though fully deserving of God’s wrath, they have been saved by God’s grace, not by anything they have done, but simply by being joined to Christ (2:1-10). As Gentiles, they were utterly alienated from God and his blessings, but in God’s mercy, through the reconciling work of Christ, they have now been made members of God’s family, fully equal to Jewish Christians. They are no longer outsiders (2:11-22).\nPaul was the one commissioned by God to bring this wonderful Good News to them (3:1-13). His second prayer for them (3:14-21) is that God will give them spiritual power, strengthen them in their faith and love, enable them to understand Christ’s saving love fully, and fill them with the life and power of God himself.\nIn response, they are to live a life of humility, grace, and love—a life worthy of their calling, as they use their God-given gifts to build up the body of Christ (4:1-16). They are to turn from the darkness of their former sinful ways and live as children of light. Filled with kindness and love in the Holy Spirit, and following the example of Christ, their lives are to please God in all things (4:17–5:20).\nAll their relationships at home—between husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and slaves—are to be characterized by respect and love, as they live for Christ (5:21–6:9). Finally, they are warned to take on God’s armor to protect themselves from the devil (6:10-20). Paul closes with some personal words and a benediction (6:21-24).\nAuthor\nEphesians is traditionally ascribed to Paul, as are the other Prison Letters (Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon). However, on the basis of vocabulary, style, form, setting, purpose, and theological emphases, some have thought that Ephesians was written instead by a later disciple of Paul. Others see it as an original letter from Paul that has been reworked by a later editor.\nHowever, the letter is not at all incompatible with Paul’s thought and style. The supposed differences with the undisputed letters of Paul can be explained by taking account of (1) variations in Paul’s own vocabulary and style; (2) the different content of this letter (for example, Eph 1–3 include extensive sections of blessing, praise, and prayer); (3) developments in Paul’s own thinking; (4) Paul’s use of secretaries (see Rom 16:22), who may have exercised some degree of freedom in putting his thoughts into their own words; and (5) the nature of Ephesians as a general letter sent to several churches, not just one. There is no compelling reason to deny that Paul authored it.\nRecipients\nThough traditionally understood to have been written to the church at Ephesus, this letter may have been written as a general letter to be circulated to a number of different churches in the Roman province of Asia. This opinion is based on (1) the omission of the introductory words in Ephesus (Eph 1:1) in many of the earliest manuscripts, and (2) the lack of personal greetings or references in Ephesians—a surprising omission if the letter was intended for the church in Ephesus, given Paul’s extended stay in the city and personal acquaintance with the church there (see Acts 19:10; 20:31).\nDate and Place of Writing\nEphesians is one of the Prison Letters (along with Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon), traditionally understood to have been written from Rome in AD 60–62 or shortly before Paul was executed around AD 64~65. This would place the Prison Letters among the last of Paul’s writings. However, they might better be understood as having been written from prison in Ephesus. In 2 Corinthians, written shortly after Paul left Ephesus, he refers to the strong opposition he encountered in the area and mentions having been in prison many times; see 2 Cor 11:23-27. If the Prison Letters were written from Ephesus, it would place them earlier in Paul’s life, around AD 53~56.\nMeaning and Message\nPraise for God’s Grace.  Perhaps more than any other book in the New Testament, Ephesians is filled with gratitude for the saving grace God has shown to those who believe in Jesus Christ. Solely by God’s grace, believers have been chosen, forgiven, called into his family, made his children, promised his eternal blessings, and given the gift of his Holy Spirit to mark them as belonging to him forever (Eph 1:3-14). Salvation can never be viewed as something that is earned; it is a sheer gift (Eph 2:8-9). As a result, believers know they are called to praise God forever for his amazing grace (Eph 1:6, 12, 14). They can do nothing less, for they owe him everything.\nThe Condemned State of Human Beings.  The awareness of grace that pervades the first three chapters of Ephesians is heightened by Paul’s contrasting emphasis on sin and God’s judgment upon it. What is true of his readers is true of everyone, since all stand under God’s judgment (see Eph 2:1-3, 12). Every human being stands guilty and condemned before the eternal judgment of God, who cannot tolerate sin. This concept seems troublingly harsh to modern ways of thinking; behind it stands a much stronger view of human sin and of the utter holiness of God than most Westerners today are used to. Apart from Christ, human beings are driven by sin and subject to the devil. Evangelism is therefore urgent (see Mark 16:15-16; cp. Rom 9:1-3; 10:1).\nThe Unity of the Church.  God’s amazing plan is to include Gentiles in his family (see Eph 2:11–3:6). Ethnic distinctions mean nothing to God and they should mean nothing to God’s people (cp. Gal 3:28). Because God has joined people from all ethnic backgrounds together in his church (see Eph 2:14-17; 3:6), believers should respond by warmly welcoming one another in humility, grace, and love, without consideration of ethnic differences (see Eph 4:1-6; Rom 15:5-7). In the church, one’s identity is defined only by one’s faith in Christ.\nLiving Like Christ.  In Eph 4–6, Paul gives us a beautiful picture of the Christian life as it ought to be lived. Believers are to turn away from the darkness of their former lives and, filled with the Holy Spirit, to live as new people of light, seeking only what is “good and right and true” (Eph 5:9). They are to express gentleness, integrity, respect, kindness, and love to others. In relation to God, their lives are to be filled with purity, praise, and thanksgiving (see Eph 4:17–5:20). Believers are to become like Christ and to reflect him in all they do and say (see Eph 4:13, 15; Rom 8:29). In Christ, they have been created anew to be like God (see Eph 4:24; 5:1-2).\nRespect and Love at Home.  In Eph 5:21–6:9, Paul emphasizes the importance of showing respect and love to those with whom one lives. He maintains and honors the traditional cultural relationships (including those between husbands and wives, parents and children, and masters and slaves), while stressing that, in all relationships, believers’ attitudes are to be those of Christ.\nSpiritual War.  Ephesians 6:10-20 gives the fullest New Testament account of how believers are to protect themselves in their war against the devil. In this spiritual battle, believers cannot rely on their own resources, but must use the weapons the Lord supplies. Significantly, all of the weapons described—except the short-bladed sword—are defensive weapons. There is no picture here of Christians attacking the devil. Though the devil’s opposition is to be taken seriously, Paul’s view of the Christian life does not center on spiritual warfare in an aggressive or offensive sense.",

    "content": "How do you live as a Christian in a non-Christian world? How do you respond when those around you are hostile to your faith? Paul wrote this poignant letter to encourage the persecuted Christians of the church in Philippi and to strengthen them in the difficulties they faced. Paul wrote while in prison—he, too, was suffering for his faith—but he demonstrated that a Christian can have joy in Christ regardless of the circumstances.\nSetting\nPhilippi was a small Roman colony in the province of Macedonia in northeastern Greece. Located about ten miles inland from the Aegean Sea, Philippi was important because of its strategic position on the Via Egnatia, the major east–west Roman route through Macedonia.\nPhilippi heard the Good News of Christ from Paul on his second missionary journey (about AD 50; see Acts 16:11-40). From the beginning, there was opposition to Paul’s preaching. During his brief stay there, he was thrown into prison and then asked to leave town, but not before a group of new believers had been established (Acts 16:35-40).\nAround six years later (AD 56~57), on his third missionary journey, Paul visited Philippi again (see Acts 20:1-6). It is possible that, after that visit, he never saw the Philippian Christians again (but see 1 Tim 1:3, written around AD 63).\nPaul wrote the letter to the Philippians while in prison. Epaphroditus had brought a monetary gift to Paul from the Philippians and was returning to Philippi, and Paul sent along with him this warm letter of encouragement for the church. Aware that the Philippians were being persecuted, he wanted to support and strengthen them, in part by sharing with them his experience as a prisoner for Christ’s sake.\nSummary\nAfter a brief introduction (1:1-2), Paul affirms his gratitude to God for the Philippians and prays for their spiritual growth (1:3-11). He then talks about his own experience of imprisonment and how it has resulted in the spread of the Good News (1:12-19). Paul’s greatest desire is to live and die for Christ, whatever his situation (1:20-26). The Philippians, too, must be strong in their faith as they suffer for Christ (1:27-30). They should warmly support one another, remembering the example of Christ, who gave up everything in sacrificing his life for theirs (2:1-18).\nEager to know how the Philippians are doing and to tell them how he is, Paul will soon be sending Epaphroditus and Timothy to them, both of whom have proven their willingness to suffer for Christ (2:19-30).\nPaul next warns the Philippians about Jewish-Christian propaganda requiring adherence to the law of Moses (3:1-3). He recounts his prior way of life, in which he was consumed with following the law. Now he has come to the realization that the only important thing is knowing Christ, sharing in his suffering and death, and experiencing his resurrection power both now and in the future (3:4-11). All believers are to be single-minded in pursuing full life in Christ (3:12–4:1).\nIn closing, Paul encourages the Philippians to fill their lives with joy, prayer, and thanksgiving, focusing their minds on God’s good gifts, even in their persecution (4:2-9). He thanks them for the gift they have sent. He tells them that he has learned to be content regardless of his circumstances, and he implies that they, too, should learn to live this way (4:1-20). As usual, Paul ends his letter with praise to God, greetings to the believers, and an invocation of the Lord’s grace (4:21-23).\nDate and Place of Writing\nEphesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon are often called the Prison Letters, as they each make reference to having been written from prison. There is no consensus on where or when the Prison Letters were written. They have traditionally been linked to Rome, where Paul was under house arrest in AD 60–62 and then later imprisoned around AD 64~65. More recently, scholars have made a case for Ephesus (AD 53~56). During Paul’s two- to three-year stay in that city, he experienced much opposition and suffering (see Acts 19:23-41; 2 Cor 11:23-28).\nLiterary Unity\nIn order to account for sudden changes of content and tone in the writing (see especially 3:2–4:3 and 4:10-20), some have suggested that Philippians is actually a combination of several different letters or fragments joined by an anonymous editor. An early Christian writer, Polycarp, spoke of “letters” of Paul to the Philippians. Many others, however, judge this to be a single coherent letter, written by Paul, who  in his letters often changes the subject unexpectedly to address new issues.\nMeaning and Message\nPaul writes from prison to Christians who are experiencing opposition, encouraging them to imitate his life and attitudes. By speaking of his own courage, commitment, confidence, and contentment even in prison, Paul encourages the Philippians to respond similarly in their situation. In doing so, he shows us that a Christian life of joy, peace, contentment, prayer, thanksgiving, and devotion to Christ can transcend all circumstances.\nThough Paul is in prison, he is not ashamed but rejoices that it has resulted in a greater spread of the Good News. He desires to be bold for Christ, whatever the consequences, for he knows he is called to live for Christ and he feels privileged to suffer for Christ (see 1:12-26). Even in prison, Paul can say that his deepest desire is to be completely filled with Christ’s life. Paul is ready to share in Christ’s suffering and death, and he is eager to experience the full power of Christ’s resurrection. Whatever happens, he will one day be raised from the dead like Christ (3:7-14). Meanwhile, Paul has learned to be content whatever his lot in life. He relies on Christ and has found Christ’s strength sufficient in even the most trying situations (4:11-13).\nPaul urges the Philippians to be full of joy in the Lord as they experience opposition. They are not to worry about anything, but to pray for all their needs with a heart full of gratitude to God. In this way, they will experience the deep peace of God (see 4:4-9).",

    "content": "The letter to the Colossians combines some of the deepest and most sublime teaching about Christ with some very basic instructions for life. As strongly as any other book in the New Testament, Colossians reminds us that Christ must always be preeminent in a Christian’s affections and worship.\nSetting\nThe city of Colosse was located about 120 miles (193 kilometers) east of Ephesus, in the province of Asia (in modern-day Turkey).\nPaul mentions Epaphras as the one who first brought the Good News to the Colossians (1:7). Epaphras was probably converted during Paul’s three-year ministry in Ephesus. Ephesus was the commercial and governmental center for the whole province, which included Colosse. Luke tells us that during Paul’s time in Ephesus, “people throughout the province of Asia . . . heard the word of the Lord” (Acts 19:10). While Paul had not visited Colosse (Col 2:1), he was the spiritual “father” of Epaphras and thus the spiritual “grandfather” of their church. So he wrote with both apostolic authority and personal caring.\nWhen Colossians was written, Epaphras was visiting Paul in prison (4:12). He had told Paul about some of the difficulties the young church was going through. He was especially concerned about some false teachers in Colosse who were emphasizing the importance of “spiritual rulers and authorities” (2:15) and “spiritual powers of this world” (2:8, 20), and thus were detracting from Christ’s preeminence. Paul wrote to address these issues.\nSummary\nColossians divides into two parts, with chs 1–2 focused on theology and chs 3–4 on practical matters.\nPaul’s greetings (1:1-2) are followed by a thanksgiving section (1:3-14), a typical way of opening a New Testament letter. Then, to make his key theological point, Paul quotes and adapts a hymn about the supremacy of Christ (1:15-20), then makes a practical application (1:21-23) before discussing his own ministry as apostle to the Gentiles (1:24–2:5). He then returns to his main point, urging the Colossians to maintain their allegiance to Christ Jesus, the one who provides for their spiritual life (2:6-15). The theological part of the letter concludes with a warning not to become preoccupied with rules as a means to spiritual fulfillment (2:16-23).\nThe more practical part of the letter (chs 3–4) opens with a general call to turn from sin and embrace the new life in Christ (3:1-11). Paul follows this with instructions for the Christian community (3:12-17) and family life (3:18–4:1). The letter concludes with an exhortation to prayer (4:2-6) and remarks about coworkers and other Christians (4:7-18).\nDate and Occasion of Writing\nColossians, Ephesians, Philemon, and Philippians are referred to as the Prison Letters—all four were written while Paul was in jail for preaching about Jesus Christ (see 4:18). Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon are closely related, having probably been written from the same place at about the same time (either Rome or Ephesus—see Ephesians Book Introduction, “Date and Place of Writing”). These three letters share common themes and vocabulary and were written to people in the same part of the world: Colosse was only about 120 miles east of Ephesus in the Roman province of Asia, and Philemon was a resident of Colosse.\nPaul mentioned some of the same coworkers in each of the Prison Letters. In his letter to Philemon, he explained why he was sending Onesimus, Philemon’s runaway slave, back to him. Onesimus also traveled with the letter to the Colossians (4:9). In both Colossians (4:7) and Ephesians (Eph 6:21), Paul said that Tychicus would give the churches more detailed information about Paul’s situation. So Tychicus was probably the messenger who carried these three letters to their destinations in Asia Minor.\nThe False Teaching\nPaul wrote to the Colossians because false teachers were disturbing the church. Colosse was an important commercial center on one of the main Roman roads in the region, so the city would have been exposed to ideas from many religions and philosophies. Like many false teachings, the “Colossian heresy” was probably a mixture of various attitudes and ideas that were in the air at the time. We cannot identify these false teachers or the details of their particular teaching, but we can see some characteristics: (1) The false teachers were apparently insisting on the observance of Sabbath and new moon festivals (2:16), which suggests some Jewish input in their viewpoint; (2) they were preoccupied with following various rules, particularly pertaining to the body (asceticism); and (3) they placed emphasis on spiritual beings, which was typical of many religious movements of the period. The basic problem is clear: The teaching did not regard Christ as the center and origin of all religious experience. Any teaching or philosophy that fails to do so is not the Good News.\nMeaning and Message\nIn his letter to the Colossians, Paul steers a young Christian church back to the apostles’ message of the Good News about Christ. To counter the influence of false teaching, Paul insisted that Christ is supreme over all beings in creation, both spiritual and physical. Jesus is the one in whom the very fullness of God resides. Jesus is also the only ultimate source of spiritual growth, the center from which all true spiritual experience must radiate (2:19). The false teachers were deriving their emphasis on rules from something other than Christ, and this meant that the rules could not produce spiritual benefit (2:23). In this case, Paul argues, addition means subtraction: Trying to add anything to Christ leads to subtracting the power that he alone gives to lead the Christian life.\nChrist has reconciled us to the God in whom we now live, so all of our spiritual needs are fulfilled by Christ. We need no one and nothing else for true spiritual fulfillment.\nPaul urged the Colossians to avoid putting too much stock in ritual practices (2:16-23). Instead, all Christians should identify with Christ in his death and resurrection (2:11, 19-20; 3:1-4) and let the Good News, as preached by the apostles, mold their thinking and behavior. Colossians reminds us that we must keep Christ at the center of all that we do, in our own spiritual journey and in the life of the church. Adding to Christ is inevitably a distortion of true Christian faith.",

    "content": "As recent converts to Christianity, the Thessalonian church lacked a full understanding of the faith and suffered severe persecution. Could the fledgling believers withstand the antagonistic social climate? First Thessalonians reminds us that faithful leaders, good teaching, and obedience help believers remain firm in their faith. The letter presents a clear vision of God as powerfully active in the lives of those he has called through the Good News of Jesus Christ.\nSetting\nThessalonica, a major city of Macedonia, enjoyed the good will of Rome and the Roman citizens who settled there. The city was not subject to Roman taxation, could mint its own coins, and was not obliged to garrison Roman troops within the city walls. It prospered as a political and commercial center whose influence extended throughout the province of Macedonia and beyond.\nThe mixed population of Thessalonica included Macedonians, Romans, Jews, and other peoples who traveled through the city. Many of the Romans who settled there became wealthy benefactors in the town. The Jewish population was large enough to have a synagogue (Acts 17:1).\nLuke reported the evangelization of Thessalonica in Acts 17:1-9. When Paul preached in the synagogue, some Jews converted to Christ. Most of the converts in Thessalonica, however, were Gentiles who abandoned idolatry to follow Christ (1 Thes 1:9).\nThe Jews who did not accept the Good News started a riot against the apostles and accused Paul and Silas of causing civil disturbance (Acts 17:4-7). The accusation was calculated to generate maximum opposition by taking advantage of the Romans’ intolerance of social unrest. As a consequence, Paul and his companions were forced to leave the city after a short time.\nPaul left a church that was very young in the faith, and it was already experiencing persecution (1 Thes 1:6; 2:14; 3:3-4). The Christians in Thessalonica had not received all the teaching they needed, nor did they have mature leadership to oversee the church. As Paul traveled on to Berea, Athens, and finally Corinth (Acts 17:10–18:1), he was deeply concerned about the welfare of the Thessalonian church. His repeated attempts to return to the city were blocked by severe circumstances that he attributed to Satan (1 Thes 2:17-18).\nWhile in Athens, Paul could no longer bear his anxiety over the church. He sent Timothy back to Thessalonica to strengthen the believers and to be sure that they had not abandoned their faith (3:1-2, 5). While Paul was in Corinth, Timothy returned from Thessalonica with the good news that the Thessalonian believers had continued in faith and love and were standing firm despite the opposition they faced (3:6-8). First Thessalonians explodes with the joy Paul experienced upon hearing this report. It expresses his thankfulness to God for their faithfulness and his prayer that he might return to see them again and establish them more fully in the faith (3:9-11).\nSummary\nFirst Thessalonians is a letter full of thanksgiving to God for the faith, love, and hope of the young Thessalonian church (1:2-3; 2:13; 3:9). Paul, however, also presents some of his concerns. In the ancient world there were many traveling orators who only sought money and fame. In 2:1–3:13, Paul defends his motives and ministry—he had not come looking for fame or fortune. He sincerely cared for the Thessalonian believers. He longed to see the church and had tried unsuccessfully to “come back” (2:17-20). Paul also affirms his care by reminding them that he had sent Timothy back to strengthen them and to find out about their welfare (3:1-5). Paul recounts how greatly comforted he was by the report Timothy brought (3:6-8), and he tells the church about his thanksgiving to God for them and his prayer that he might see them again (3:9-13).\nSome in the congregation had ignored Paul’s teaching about sexual morality. In response, Paul emphasizes God’s will for them to be holy (4:1-8). In addition, certain individuals within the church were refusing to work, ignoring the teaching and example of the apostles in this regard (4:11-12; 5:14; see 2 Thes 3:6-15).\nThe Thessalonians also had some questions for Paul. First, what happens to believers who die before Christ’s return? Paul answers that such people will be the first to be raised from the dead and will be caught up with the living to meet the Lord at the time of his appearing (1 Thes 4:13-18). Second, when will Christ return and bring about the final consummation? Paul replies that the day will come at an unexpected moment, like a thief in the night (5:1-11), so they should be prepared by living in faith, love, and hope.\nThe letter closes with several exhortations on living a life that pleases God. Paul reminds the church to honor its emerging leaders (5:12-13). In addition, Paul instructs the Thessalonians that they should not reject prophecies but evaluate them (5:19-22). The letter concludes with a blessing that expresses Paul’s absolute confidence in God’s faithfulness and work in their lives (5:23-24).\nAuthor\nThe names of Silas and Timothy, cofounders of the church in Thessalonica, are listed in (1:1) alongside the name of Paul. The letter is mostly written in the first person plural (“we”), indicating that Silas and Timothy might have had a real part in the letter’s composition. Paul only occasionally steps out individually to express his particular concerns (2:18; 3:5; 5:27). Joint composition of letters was known in the ancient world. For example, in his letter Ad Atticum, Cicero refers to “letters—both that which you wrote in conjunction with others and the one you wrote in your own name.” However, the final command in 5:27 suggests that Paul had the major hand in writing, whatever the role of his companions may have been.\nDate and Occasion of Writing\nPaul wrote this epistle from Corinth during his second missionary journey (Acts 15:36–18:22) after Timothy returned from visiting the Thessalonian church (1 Thes 3:6; Acts 18:5). Gallio was named as proconsul of the Roman province of Achaia in AD 51, during Paul’s stay in Corinth (Acts 18:11-12). Therefore, Paul probably wrote this letter during the latter part of AD 50. First Thessalonians is one of Paul’s earliest epistles, second only to Galatians.\nMeaning and Message\nFirst Thessalonians provides a look into the life and struggles of a new congregation of believers. These new converts were greatly disadvantaged because the founders of their church were only present for a short time. The new believers were experiencing great hostility from their own countrymen because of their faith (1:6; 2:14; 3:3-4). Paul believed they were under attack by Satan, the tempter (3:5), who had also hindered him from visiting them again (2:18). When Timothy returned from visiting them, Paul was overjoyed to discover that the Thessalonians were exhibiting the character of people truly converted to Christ. Their lives were marked by faith, love, and hope (1:3; 3:6; 5:8). They even helped to spread the Good News throughout the surrounding regions (1:8) and became examples for other believers of true faith in the midst of suffering (1:6-7).\nWhat enabled the Thessalonians to stand firm in faith in the face of great adversity? Some might attribute such perseverance to simple resolve, good upbringing, or just “blind faith.” But Paul emphasizes that believers are chosen by God (1:4) and that the Good News is the divine message and witness of God’s power (1:5). When people receive this message, it continues to work powerfully in them (2:13). Genuine conversion means turning to the true God in repentance and serving him while awaiting the return of his Son from heaven (1:9-10). Although the Christians in Thessalonica were young in the faith, separated from their church founders, and suffering for their conversion to Christ, God was at work in them. Such strength of faith is the work of Christ (3:8, 13).\nStill, these new Christians needed to grow in moral character and theological understanding. Paul had warned the Thessalonians about sexual immorality, but some dismissed his teaching (4:3-8). They also did not understand that their belief in Christ’s resurrection was their source of hope in the face of the bitter reality of death (4:13-18). They were confused about when Christ would return (5:1-11). Some in the church did not heed Paul’s teaching about work (4:11; 5:14), and others were not properly respecting the emerging leaders in the church (5:12-13). Finally, some Thessalonians were repressing prophecy in the church (5:19-22).\nAlthough correction may seem distasteful, we need it for proper moral and theological growth. Paul, as a wise pastor, writes this letter to help the Thessalonian believers with these issues. His hope is that the letter will address these problems until he is able to return (3:10). In the end, every leader should entrust believers to God’s work in their lives (5:23) since he is faithful (5:24).",

    "content": "The believers in Thessalonica had faced persecution since their conversion, but now it was more severe. A false teaching declared that the day of the Lord had already come, and some believers even quit working. What do you say to people whose lives move from bad to worse? Paul’s second letter to this new church addresses their troubling problems.\nSetting\nFrom the time of their conversion, the Thessalonian Christians had experienced hostility (1 Thes 1:6; 2:14), and Paul had worried whether they would retain their faith (1 Thes 3:5). When Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians, they had stood firm in faith, love, and hope (1 Thes 1:3; 3:6-8).\nAfter Paul sent his first letter, the situation in the Thessalonian church deteriorated and the persecution intensified. What Paul had previously written was being countered by a false teaching that said that the day of the Lord had already come (2:2). Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians after receiving this news (2:2; 3:11) in order to give this church a shift in perspective.\nSummary\nSecond Thessalonians opens with the customary greeting (1:1-2), then quickly moves to thanksgiving for the church’s faith, love, and persevering hope, which had become a model for other congregations (1:3-4). Noting their suffering, Paul says that God will judge their persecutors and bring reward to the Thessalonian believers (1:5-10). Paul gives thanks for this church and prays that God will continue to make them worthy of his calling (1:11-12). In spite of their troubles, Paul is confident in God’s work among them.\nPaul counters the false teaching that “the day of the Lord has already begun” (2:1-2) and urges the church not to be deceived by this doctrine (2:3). He outlines events that will precede Christ’s coming, when the church will be gathered to meet him (2:1-12). First, there will be rebellion against God (2:3). Then “the man of lawlessness” will come, who will claim to be divine and demand worship (2:3-4). Although he will be empowered by Satan and will deceive many, Jesus will destroy him (2:8-12).\nPaul is confident that God chose and called the Thessalonian Christians, and he urges them to stand firm (2:13-15). Paul concludes his discussion on final events with a prayer for the church (2:16-17) and a request that they pray for him as he preaches the Good News (3:1-2). His confidence in the church is based on God’s handiwork in them (3:3-5).\nIn the closing section (3:6-18), Paul returns to an issue that he had addressed in the first letter. Some believers were refusing to work, despite Paul’s instruction and example, so Paul calls on the church to discipline them (3:6-10). He also addresses these idle members directly, telling them to get to work (3:11-12). He commands the church to treat these slackers as errant Christians rather than hostile enemies (3:14-15), and he encourages the church to continue its generosity toward those in genuine need (3:13). He closes the letter with prayers and a final greeting (3:16-18).\nAuthorship\nPaul’s name is in the letter opening (1:1); at the conclusion, Paul adds a note in his own hand to certify the letter’s authenticity (3:17). As in 1 Thessalonians, the names of Silas and Timothy, the cofounders of this church, are included alongside Paul’s, indicating that they stood behind the contents of the letter and probably shared in its writing. Most of the first-person pronouns in the letter are plural (“we”), suggesting that Silas and Timothy had real input into the letter and that their names were not included simply as a courtesy. However, the final greeting in Paul’s own writing emphasizes that he is the primary author, personally responsible for the contents of the letter.\nThe early church unanimously affirmed that 2 Thessalonians was a genuine letter of the apostle Paul, and the letter is in harmony with Paul’s other writings.\nRecipients\nThe recipients of the letter were the same as those who received 1 Thessalonians: “the church in Thessalonica, . . . you who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (2 Thes 1:1). Many were artisans who earned their living by manual labor (3:6-12) or were clients of rich patrons. They were not people who had great wealth.\nMeaning and Message\nWars are often fought on multiple fronts. This was certainly the case with the conflict in the church at Thessalonica. With persecutors assailing the church, false doctrine circulating, and unruly members refusing to work, the battle lines were numerous. In his response, however, Paul never embraces despair or exasperation. He is very clear in his teaching and correction. He intends for his words to strengthen the troubled church, stop the false teaching, and correct the errant members.\nThe value of Paul’s second letter to the Thessalonians is not merely in figuring out how events will occur at the end of human history, but that has often been the approach to the second chapter of this letter. Second Thessalonians is primarily a pastoral letter from Paul that provides hope and confidence in God when the world has gone mad. Christ reigns now, and Christ will be triumphant in the end.",

    "content": "During the final phase of Paul’s apostolic career, a serious disruption was troubling the long-established Christian church in Ephesus: Some church leaders had become false teachers. Paul had warned that this would happen (Acts 20:29-31), and now their impact was threatening the life and well-being of the community. A skillful person was needed to restore order to God’s household. Paul gave this task to Timothy, his trusted delegate.\nSetting\nPaul’s first contact with Ephesus, during his second missionary journey (Acts 18:19-21), gave no opportunity for significant work. During his third journey, Paul served in Ephesus for three years (around AD 53~56, Acts 19). Later, when Paul was on his way to Jerusalem, he had opportunity to stop at Miletus and speak to the elders from Ephesus, who met him there (Acts 20:17-38). Paul traveled to Jerusalem, was arrested, was later transferred to Caesarea, and was then sent to Rome, where he stayed under house arrest for approximately two years (AD 60–62, Acts 21–28). When he was released from prison, he reembarked on his mission, possibly directed toward Spain (see Rom 15:24, 28), although it is just as possible that the imprisonment changed Paul’s orientation back eastward. Paul was still involved with the Ephesian church during this period.\nTimothy, who had accompanied Paul for much of his original ministry there (Acts 19:22), had now been delegated the task of dealing with new and troubling developments in Ephesus (1 Tim 1:3). False teachers had emerged (1:3) and were evidently upsetting households (see 1 Tim 2:15; 3:4-5; 5:11-15; cp. Titus 1:11). Paul wrote Timothy to guide him in correcting errant behavior and in preventing false teachers from gaining another foothold.\nSummary\nAfter directing Timothy to deal with the false teachers, who espoused to be teachers of the law (1:3-20), Paul gives guidance on conduct in God’s household with respect to prayer, women’s teaching, and leadership (2:1–3:13). These three areas had been harmed by the false teachers. Paul makes clear what he is trying to accomplish and explains why and how it must be done (3:14–4:16). Then he resumes his instructions on godly conduct, focusing on old and young people, widows, elders, and masters (5:1–6:2). Relationships in these areas had also been distorted by false teaching. Finally, Paul returns to the need to deal with the false teachers themselves, this time centering on issues of wealth and profit (6:2-21).\nAuthorship\nThere is a widespread view that the Pastoral Letters (1 Timothy—Titus) were not written by Paul. According to this view, a follower of Paul wrote the Pastoral Letters after his death and signed his name. There are several good reasons, however, to believe that Paul is the author: (1) Until the 1800s, there was no hesitation in ascribing these letters to Paul. This includes early church fathers whose native language was Greek and who were very familiar with Paul’s other letters. (2) The early church would never have accepted these letters had they suspected the letters of being falsely signed in Paul’s name. (3) While Paul’s style in these letters is different from elsewhere, this might simply be a result of the specific situations Paul was addressing and the distinctive period of Paul’s life and career during which these letters were written. It also might result from the use of a different amanuensis (scribe) for these letters. It is reasonable to affirm Paul’s authorship of the Pastoral Letters.\nDate of Writing\nThe Pastoral Letters (1 Timothy—Titus) were most likely written after Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome (AD 60–62, Acts 28:1-31) and before his death in AD 64~65 under the persecution of Nero.\nIn 2 Timothy, Paul is jailed in Rome at the end of his life (see 2 Tim 4:6). This would seem to place the letters of 1 Timothy and Titus—written while Paul was still moving freely—in the time leading up to his arrest. How do these details fit with Acts?\nOne possibility is that 2 Timothy was written during the Roman imprisonment of Acts 28. In this case, all three letters would fit into Luke’s historical account in the book of Acts, and Paul would have been executed at the end of that imprisonment (AD 62).\nThere are early reports, however, that Paul was released from this Roman imprisonment (e.g., 1 Clement 5:6-7, AD 95~97; see also Eusebius, Church History 2.22, AD 325). If this is the case, he likely engaged in further work, possibly went to Spain, and was then rearrested and executed in Rome during Nero’s persecution of Christians (around AD 64~65). The letters to Timothy and Titus were likely written during this later period.\nIn support of this approach, there is no reason that these letters must be fitted into the history recorded in Acts. Also, the activities of Paul and his delegates in 1 Timothy and Titus do not correspond to the details in Acts, nor does the imprisonment of 2 Timothy sound like the imprisonment of Acts 28. Finally, the distinctive style and content of these letters is less puzzling if they were written at a different time from Paul’s other letters.\nThe False Teachers\nThe false teachers discussed in 1 Timothy bear much resemblance to similar figures whom Paul mentions in both 2 Timothy and Titus. It is very difficult to draw a clear picture of these false teachers, but there are clues. Their teaching had ascetic elements (see 1 Tim 4:3; Titus 1:15) and a Jewish focus (see 1 Tim 1:7; Titus 1:10, 14; 3:9). They claimed special knowledge (1 Tim 6:20; Titus 1:16), asserted that the resurrection of believers had already taken place (2 Tim 2:18), disrupted relationships (2 Tim 3:6-7; Titus 1:11), and might have emphasized salvation by works (2 Tim 1:9; Titus 3:5). Paul’s strong response suggests a need to make corrections regarding the doctrine of Christ (see 1 Tim 2:5-6; 3:16; 2 Tim 2:8) and the last days (see 1 Tim 4:1-5; 2 Tim 2:18; 3:1-9; Titus 2:11-14). The false teachers opposed Paul’s message, promoted immorality, and undercut the church’s mission. Thus, good leaders were needed (see Titus 1:10-13; 2:6-8, 15).\nMeaning and Message\nFirst Timothy is passionate and masterful advocacy for the Good News of Jesus Christ, its ongoing progress in the world, and the new life which it creates and promotes (see 3:14-16).\nGod’s household was Paul’s immediate concern. Just as the surrounding society expected orderly conduct in the family household—with roles and decorum and notions of honor and shame—so it was with the household of God. God’s household reflects widely accepted standards of honor and propriety as well as the social structures of society. At the same time, where proper and necessary, God’s household runs counter to society, reflecting very different and even countercultural values and practices. God’s household is in the world, but not of it. The world remains God’s good creation (4:3-4; 6:17), but it is transient and is in its last, difficult, evil-ridden days (4:1; 2 Tim 3:1). God’s household reflects the new creation even as it exists in the world.\nThe mission of God’s household is to advance the Good News in the world and promote the will of God (see 1 Tim 2:4-7). God’s people should do what supports that mission (2:1–3:13; 5:1–6:2; see 1 Cor 9:19-23). The false teachers were, by contrast, talking foolishness and damaging the integrity of the church, so Paul directed most of his words toward right conduct. The condensed summaries of the Good News (1 Tim 1:15; 2:5-6; 3:16; 6:13-16) indicate what was actually under assault—the right understanding of salvation in the present age. This is what must be preserved, skillfully taught, and passed along—with godly life as its outcome.",

    "content": "Back in a Roman prison, Paul realized that he had reached the end of his race. His life, modeled on the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, was nearing its conclusion, so Paul commissioned his delegate Timothy to carry on his work. When Paul died at the hands of the Romans, this letter essentially became his epitaph (see 4:7-8), and through it, he empowered the church to carry on in his absence. The mission of the Good News would continue.\nSetting\nFollowing Paul’s conversion (Acts 9:1-19), his work as an apostle extended from Jerusalem in the east to as far west as Italy (Acts 28:30-31; Rom 15:19), including considerable time in Asia Minor, and especially Ephesus (Acts 19:1–20:1; 20:31). This period ended when Paul was arrested in Jerusalem (Acts 21:27-36), detained in Caesarea (Acts 23:23–26:32), and imprisoned in Rome (Acts 28:16-31). Paul was eventually released, and he engaged in further ministry. He wrote 1 Timothy and Titus during this time. He was then arrested and imprisoned in Rome a second time (1:8, 16-17; 2:9).\nThis letter, written from prison in Rome, came during the concluding episode of Paul’s life (see 4:6-18). It was written to Timothy, Paul’s faithful coworker and delegate. Timothy was in the province of Asia at that time, probably in Ephesus (4:13, 19). Paul was asking him to come to Rome as soon as possible. Suffering and persecution were likely for Timothy, too, if he came.\nSummary\nAfter the traditional salutation (1:1-2), thanksgiving, and prayer (1:3-4), Paul charges Timothy to suffer with him for the Good News (1:5-18). The resources for doing so include Timothy’s spiritual heritage and the Good News itself, as illustrated by Paul’s life and by both good and bad examples.\nPaul then charges Timothy again (2:1-13) to be strong and to endure suffering along with him. Again, Timothy’s obedience is to be motivated by reflection on the Good News and on Paul’s example. Paul then instructs Timothy on conducting his ministry among the false teachers (2:14-26).\nThe perspective then broadens to set Timothy’s task in the context of the last days (3:1–4:8). These days will be difficult, but God will deal with troublemakers just as he has in the past. Timothy is to stay on track with the faith he has inherited and remain rooted in the Scriptures. He is to carry out his ministry with a sense of urgency in light of his hope and the increasing resistance of his listeners. He is not to be afraid of suffering for the Lord, and he is to consider Paul’s work as completed. Timothy must step into the gap and continue to follow the example of Paul.\nThe letter closes with an appeal for Timothy to come to Rome as soon as possible (4:9-18). Paul gives greetings, news, and a final urging for Timothy to make his journey to Rome before winter (4:19-21). Then Paul closes with a blessing (4:22).\nDate of Writing\nIt is possible that 2 Timothy was written during Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome (Acts 28:1-31). The evidence, however, gives stronger support to a later date, during a second imprisonment in Rome that resulted in Paul’s death (see 1 Timothy Book Introduction, “Date of Writing”).\nOccasion of Writing\nWe do not know the details of Paul’s second arrest. Perhaps Alexander (4:14-15), a heretic whom Paul had disciplined earlier (1 Tim 1:20), had a hand in the arrest (see 2 Tim 4:16-18). It might have occurred in Asia Minor (see 1:15); if so, Paul’s heretical opponents—the false teachers discussed in 1 Timothy and Titus—were not just making idle threats. The struggle in which Paul and Timothy were engaged (2 Tim 2:3; 4:7; see also 1 Tim 1:18; 6:12) was not simply metaphorical or spiritual. The directions on prayer for civil authorities (1 Tim 2:1-7; cp. Titus 3:1) may be understood as relating to wider problems created for the churches by false teachers, problems that resulted in Paul’s final arrest and execution for the Good News. The false teachers were still on the prowl (2 Tim 2:14–3:9; 4:14-15). Paul viewed his ministry as being completed and knew that his death was imminent (4:6-8), so he was encouraging Timothy to carry on the work. It is possible that a visit to Paul in Rome would have included some sort of formal commissioning of Timothy.\nMeaning and Message\nThe apostle Paul had not only proclaimed the Good News of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; he had personally enacted it. The Good News gives rise to a way of life that takes up the cross and follows Jesus in the life-giving power of his resurrection. Paul had modeled his life after Christ’s, and now his death was at hand. God’s work will be completed right up to the day of Christ’s return (1:12), and the continuing responsibility of God’s servants is great. Paul passed the torch to Timothy and challenged him to carry his work forward.\nAs with Timothy, all who take up the cross and follow Jesus are charged to complete the ministry that God has given them, through the life-giving power of Christ’s resurrection.",

    "content": "The church in Crete was full of new converts in a culture where conduct was very crude. Paul, the aged missionary, demonstrates a mature finesse in applying the Good News to the spiritual condition and circumstances of these believers in Crete as the church was beginning to grow.\nSetting\nA group from Crete had been in Jerusalem during Pentecost at the birth of the Christian church (Acts 2:11). Some of these might have carried the Christian faith back to the island at that time, but this letter to Titus suggests that the church on Crete had been recently founded as a result of Paul’s mission (see Titus 1:5). The only other mention of Crete in the New Testament comes during Paul’s transfer to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 27:7-21). Paul did not have an opportunity to do active ministry in Crete at that time. Most likely, Paul’s work in Crete began after the events of Acts 28:1-31 (AD 60–62) and before his final Roman imprisonment (probably around AD 64~65).\nAs during his first missionary journey out of Antioch, Paul had begun the church in Crete without appointing leaders. As with those earliest churches, he now wanted leaders to be established (cp. Acts 14:23), although in this case he delegated the responsibility to Titus, a longtime coworker. Paul was headed for Nicopolis (on the west coast of modern Greece), and he wanted Titus to join him there when Artemas or Tychicus had arrived on the island of Crete (Titus 3:12). Paul’s plan to winter at Nicopolis suggests that he planned to sail westward from there when spring arrived (see 2 Tim 4:21), probably heading for Italy and possibly Spain (see Rom 15:24, 28).\nOn Crete, the degenerate culture was negatively influencing the believers in the young church. False teachers were also troubling the community, seemingly like those mentioned in 1 and 2 Timothy. As Paul’s delegate to Crete, Titus had to set this church in order before the arrival of Artemas or Tychicus. Above all, he needed to assign elders in each city. When this was completed, he would depart and join Paul.\nSummary\nThe letter to Titus is all business, setting the tone for Titus himself to follow. Each section of the letter body (1:5–3:11) is composed in a pattern of command, rationale, and charge. Paul consistently repeats this pattern—whether addressing the appointment of elders (1:5-16), right conduct among members of the household of faith (2:1-15), or right conduct in society at large (3:1-11). The rationale for Paul’s commands in the first section, on leadership, is that the community is threatened by false teachers and needs decisive leadership. In the next two sections, on right conduct, the commands are based on God’s grace and mercy.\nDate of Writing\nTitus was written at about the same time as 1 Timothy. It is possible that Paul wrote these letters and 2 Timothy during the period prior to his arrest in Acts 21, but a date sometime after the imprisonment of Acts 28 is more likely (see 1 Timothy Book Introduction, “Date of Writing”).\nSituation on Crete\nAccording to Cretan mythology, the god Zeus was once a mere human who lived and died on Crete but who had achieved godhood through the benefits he gave to humans (see study note on 1:12). The idea of a great human benefactor being exalted to the status of a god by virtue of good deeds contradicts the Good News. God graciously lowered himself to humanity in Jesus Christ—“our great God and Savior” (2:13)—and offers salvation through pure mercy (3:5).\nComparison with 1 and 2 Timothy\nAlthough Crete is some distance from the church in Ephesus (the recipients of 1 & 2 Timothy), there are some intriguing parallels between the two situations. The characterization of the false teachers and their teaching (Titus 1:10-16) suggests that quite similar teachings were being confronted in both places (see 1 Tim 1:4-7; 4:1-4; 2 Tim 3:1-7; 4:3-4).\nThat said, the situation on Crete as addressed in Titus is not identical to that of Ephesus in 1 & 2 Timothy. Evidently, the church in Crete was new, whereas the church in Ephesus was long established. Crete was socially less civilized than Ephesus. The newness of the church in Crete might explain the absence of a widows list (1 Tim 5:3-16) and deacons (1 Tim 3:8-13). The differences in the troublemakers might account for the silence on the subject of women teachers (see 1 Tim 2:11-15). The criteria for leaders (Titus 1:6-9), as well as the standards of conduct for members of the community (see 2:1-10), might represent a lowering of the bar to accommodate new converts from an uncouth background. Finally, the stress on guarding the deposit, so important in Timothy (1 Tim 1:18; 6:20; 2 Tim 1:12-14; 2:2), is absent in Titus.\nMeaning and Message\nCentral to this letter is the realization that the Christian community should enact God’s saving grace, which has been shown to the world in the person and work of Jesus Christ. The community’s behavior among its members, and in relation to those outside, should be consistent with the way that God had dealt with them. Christians must embody God’s grace in the world and toward the world. In so doing, they will advance the Good News within their territory and culture (2:10-11; 3:2-3, 8; see Matt 5:14-16).\nThe drama of the divine salvation of humanity invites participation. As Christ’s followers, we must become players in this performance of grace. Our communities should promote godly lives because the appearance of grace, in the person of Christ, has taught us how to live and has made such living possible (Titus 2:1-15). As individual believers, we must also conduct ourselves properly in a fallen world, with hearts bent on the salvation of others. We must bear in mind our former lives—remembering how God has dealt with us, has given us salvation, and has provided for our godliness (3:1-11).",

    "content": "This brief letter, the shortest and most personal of Paul’s letters, shows how attitudes and relationships are transformed by Christ. It was written on behalf of Onesimus, a runaway slave, who was returning to Philemon, his master. Paul encouraged Philemon to go beyond the traditional master–slave relationship by welcoming Onesimus back as a beloved brother in Christ. With these words of reconciliation, Paul reminds us that all relationships among Christians, regardless of a person’s social standing, are transformed by the love of Christ.\nSetting\nA slave named Onesimus seems to have run away from his Christian master, Philemon. Philemon resided in Colosse, a small town in the Roman province of Asia (now western Turkey) about 120 miles (193 kilometers) east of Ephesus. When Onesimus ran away, he might have stolen some of his master’s things. Somehow Onesimus came into contact with Paul, who was in prison, and became a believer through Paul’s ministry. When Paul became aware that Onesimus was a runaway slave, he encouraged him to return to his master.\nSlavery was widespread in the Roman world and, by law, captured runaways had to be returned to their owners. They often faced severe punishment, such as whipping, branding, or execution, as an example to other slaves. However, Philemon was a well-respected Christian leader and a gracious, loving person. Paul wrote this letter to Philemon from prison and sent it with Onesimus to ensure a warm Christian welcome for the runaway on what might have been a rather fearful return to his master. The letter resembles a letter of recommendation and carries the full weight of Paul’s apostolic authority.\nWe do not know what happened when Onesimus returned. Some fifty or sixty years later, however, in a letter written to the Christians at Ephesus by the Christian martyr Ignatius, the name Onesimus appears again, this time as the name of the highly-regarded bishop of the province of Asia. We cannot be sure it was the same person, but it is quite possible that, because of his close association with Paul, the young slave rose to prominence in the church and eventually became bishop of the entire province. Paul’s letter is a reminder that traditional class distinctions are of no significance in the church of Jesus Christ.\nSummary\nPaul encourages Philemon to treat Onesimus no longer simply as a slave but as a genuine brother in Christ. Using his traditional opening (1:1-3), Paul introduces himself, greets Philemon, his family, and the church that meets in their home, and invokes grace and peace upon them. Paul then thanks God for Philemon, especially for his trust in the Lord Jesus and the love he has shown to so many of God’s people (1:4-7).\nPaul then makes his appeal for Onesimus (1:8-22). Though formerly a runaway, Onesimus has now become a believer in Christ and has proven himself to be a changed person. Paul asks Philemon to be gracious and forgiving in welcoming his slave back. Paul’s real desire is for Onesimus to stay with him, to assist him in his ministry from prison. Although he has the apostolic authority to demand that Philemon release him for that purpose, he refuses to use that authority, desiring that such an expression of mercy come from Philemon himself and not be forced. But Paul clearly hints that Philemon should consider freeing his slave for the work of the Good News.\nThe letter ends in a customary way (1:23-25). Paul sends greetings to Philemon from various Christians, then invokes the grace of Christ upon him and all those in his home.\nOccasion of Writing\nThough the traditional interpretation is that Onesimus was a runaway slave, other possibilities have been posed. For example, Onesimus might have been sent as a messenger to Paul, or he might have turned to Paul to mediate a problem that had arisen between him and his master. In reality, we do not know why he left his master’s home, but the traditional interpretation fits the letter well.\nDate and Place of Writing\nIt is traditionally believed that Paul wrote the Prison Letters (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon) when he was in prison in Rome (AD 60–62 or about AD 64~65). It is also quite possible that these letters were written from Ephesus during an earlier imprisonment. See Ephesians Book Introduction, “Date and Place of Writing.”\nMeaning and Message\nThis letter is a vivid illustration of the way that attitudes and relationships are transformed in Christ. Those who know Christ are to see people through the eyes of love and to express that love in their relationships with others.\nPaul’s appeal to Philemon reminds us that, as Christians, we must always be willing to forgive one another. No matter how much we have been wronged by others, we must be quick to give them a warm-hearted welcome and show them our acceptance and love.\nIn the church of Christ, traditional social distinctions, such as the relationship between slave and master, must be transcended. We must show genuine love to all Christians, regardless of their economic or cultural status, education, ethnicity, or gender (see Gal 3:28; Col 3:11). Paul’s desire to reconcile Philemon and Onesimus is an example of such love.\nMany people have wondered why Paul did not explicitly call for Onesimus’s freedom or for the abolition of slavery as an institution. In the Roman world, slavery was widespread; it was an integral part of society, and the whole of society was built on it. Paul, like most early Christians, seems to have accepted the traditional structures of society, including slavery. The mission of the early Christians was not to overthrow the structures of society but to see people converted and built up in Christ. Proclaiming the Good News of salvation would result in lives and relationships being transformed by Christ within the fellowship of the church.\nThough Paul did not explicitly call for Onesimus’s release, he clearly hinted that he would like to see him freed for the work of the Good News. In his consistent emphasis on the importance of Christians living together in forgiveness and mutual love, he was planting the seeds that would one day result in the overthrow of slavery as an institution.",

    "content": "Have you ever known a person who turned his or her back on Christ and the church and simply walked away? Perhaps you have struggled to maintain your own Christian commitment in the face of disillusionment, spiritual confusion, loss of perspective, or outright persecution. The book of Hebrews points us to Christ. It provides light to help struggling Christians see Jesus clearly and stand firm.\nSetting\nAs Christianity spread throughout the Mediterranean world, the first followers of Jesus Christ faced grave challenges. The Greco-Roman society misunderstood and mistrusted both Jews and Christians and considered them “atheists” because they did not believe in the Greek or Roman gods. Opposition to Christianity also arose from within traditional Judaism. Many Jews rejected Jesus as the Messiah. Those who converted to faith in Christ—from a Jewish or Gentile background—often paid a high price in their jobs, family connections, friendships, and other social associations. Persecution of Christians was common.\nThe believers to whom Hebrews was addressed probably belonged to a group of house churches in Rome in the early 60s AD. The Christian community in Rome was likely founded in the AD 30s when those present at Pentecost (Acts 2:10) made their way home. Roman believers had demonstrated courage and endurance (Heb 10:32-34), but by the time Hebrews was written, the spiritual fervor of some had grown cold (5:11-14), and their theological perspective was skewed (2:1). Some had even abandoned Christ and the church (6:4-8).\nSummary\nHebrews is an energetic, well-crafted pastoral response to the needs of struggling people. In the style of a first-century sermon, the author alternates between exposition on the person and work of Christ and exhortation of the hearers to obedience and endurance. Through a detailed discussion on God’s Son, along with warnings, challenges, examples, and reminders of God’s faithfulness, the author calls the readers to persevere in following Christ.\nFollowing an introduction to the whole sermon (1:1-4), the author’s exposition of Christ’s superiority develops in two great movements. The first movement (1:5–2:18) explains the Son’s relationship to the angels. The angels are servants (1:6-7, 14), but the exalted Son (1:13), with his unique relationship with the Father (1:5), is the Lord, creator, and sustainer of the universe—indeed, he is God (1:8-12). The author exhorts the hearers to pay careful attention to the message of salvation they have been taught (2:1-4), and then resumes the exposition. The exalted Christ’s position was temporarily lower than the angels when he became human (2:5-9); Jesus took on flesh and blood in order to die to set us free (2:10-18). The first exposition is followed by exhortation (3:1–4:13) that focuses on the need for faithful obedience and a continued promise of rest for God’s people.\nThe second movement of the exposition (4:14–10:18) addresses the position of the Son, our High Priest, in relation to the Old Testament sacrificial system. After introducing this theme 4:14-16, the author addresses the Son’s appointment as the superior High Priest (5:1-10) and confronts the community with their spiritual immaturity (5:11–6:20). A discussion of Melchizedek’s superiority to the Levitical priests (7:1-10) lays the groundwork for presenting Jesus as the superior High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek (7:11-28). In short, Jesus was not appointed according to the conventions of the Old Testament law, which said that priests should come from the tribe of Levi. Rather, he was appointed by God with an oath, on the basis of his indestructible life. The exposition then considers the superior offering of this appointed High Priest (8:3–10:18). Like the earthly priests, this superior priest had to make an offering for sins, but his offering was a new-covenant offering (8:7-13) that was superior to the old (9:1–10:18).\nThe final main section (10:19–13:25) is an exhortation that challenges the hearers to respond in faithfulness to the message about Christ. The book ends with a benediction and a formal conclusion (13:20-25).\nAuthorship\nUnlike many other letters of the New Testament, Hebrews does not begin by identifying its author and recipients; many scholars today believe that this is because the book was originally written as a sermon. Since the earliest centuries of the church, the authorship of Hebrews has been much discussed. The book circulated with Paul’s letters, and some church fathers in the eastern half of the Mediterranean world (such as Origen and Clement of Alexandria) argued that Paul was the author. Others, especially around Rome, did not think Paul had written the book.\nAlmost all scholars today agree that Paul was not the author of Hebrews. First, in 2:3, the author is depicted as having received the Good News from the original witnesses who followed Christ, and this does not sound at all like Paul (see Rom 1:1; 1 Cor 15:8; Gal 1:11-16). Second, the style, theological images, and vocabulary are quite different from Paul’s; for example, Hebrews uses 169 words not found elsewhere in the New Testament.\nThrough the centuries, many other possible authors for the book have been suggested, such as Philip, Priscilla, Luke, Barnabas, Jude, and Clement of Rome. One of the most popular ideas, since Martin Luther first made the suggestion, is that Apollos wrote it. Luke describes Apollos in Acts 18:24-26 as an eloquent man from Alexandria who was a powerful orator and preacher.\nAlthough we cannot identify the author of Hebrews with certainty, a careful study of the book reveals much about them. First, the excellent Greek in which the book is written and its expertly crafted forms of expression point to a highly educated person. Second, the author of Hebrews must have been a dynamic preacher, one trained in interpretation and exposition, who had memorized large portions of the Old Testament. Third, and most importantly, this author was a deeply concerned Christian leader who addressed their readers urgently and with passion. Hebrews is not simply a theological treatise, but a pastoral appeal that vies for the hearts and minds of those who are struggling in their Christian commitment.\nRecipients\nThe author writes, “Greet all your leaders and all the believers there. The believers from Italy send you their greetings” (Heb 13:24). The author seems to have been writing back to Italy, and probably to Rome, sending greetings from Italian Christians who had traveled abroad.\nThose addressed in this letter seem to have had some background in Jewish worship. The author’s use of the Old Testament and the theological concepts that are presented would have been familiar to those of the synagogue in the Mediterranean world. This does not necessarily mean that all of the recipients were Jews, since many Gentiles were part of the synagogue as “God-fearers” who worshiped the God of Israel.\nOccasion of Writing\nSome in the Christian community were evidently struggling to maintain their commitment as they were being persecuted. Passages such as Hebrews 10:32-39 suggest that this group of believers, which had faced persecution in the past, was facing it again. In the crucible of having to stand for Christ and the church in the face of public opposition, some were faltering spiritually and others had apparently turned their backs on the faith altogether. The author thus challenges this group of professed Christ followers to endure in their public profession of Christ.\nIf we are correct that Rome is the destination for this book, this word of exhortation might have been precipitated by the persecution that occurred under the emperor Nero, whose intense persecution and martyrdom of Christians in the mid-60s AD is well known. It is also possible that Hebrews was written after AD 70. This seems less likely, however, because at the time Hebrews was written, apparently no one in the community had faced martyrdom (see 12:4), but the pressure of persecution was on the rise.\nMeaning and Message\nGod has spoken about his Son and through his Son (1:1-3), and there are dire consequences for those who do not listen and respond with obedience to that word (2:1-3). In the end, Jesus, the creator and sustainer of the universe (1:2-3), will put away the created order like a person rolls up an article of old clothing (1:10-12).\nJesus is supremely worthy of our commitment, worship, and endurance in the faith. He is superior to the angels (1:5-14), to Moses (3:1-6), and to the Levitical priesthood of the old covenant (5:1-10; 7:1-28).\nJesus has made a new, heavenly covenant, offering himself once for all through his own death (8:3–10:18). In his incarnation he endured as a faithful Son (3:1-6; 5:7-8; 12:1-2), and in his exaltation he reigns as the supreme Lord of the universe (1:2-4, 8-13). Jesus thus provides us with a superior basis for persevering in the Christian life and having hope for the future.\nWe can also look to positive examples of others who have been faithful in their journey to God’s eternal city (see 6:13-15; 10:32-39; 11:1-40), and  to negative examples of those who fell through disobedience (see 3:7-19; 6:4-8). And we can embrace God’s promises to us concerning our inheritance as his children (4:3-11; 6:13-20; 12:22-24).\nBecause of Jesus, we can live as faithful members of the Christian community in our relationships and in our worship (13:1-17). Our perseverance in the Christian faith will be directly proportional to the clarity with which we understand who Jesus is and what he has accomplished on our behalf.",

    "content": "Can we be faithful friends of God like Abraham? Can we resist the pressures of the world, our rebellious human impulses, and the influence of the devil? Can Christians live together in peace as we seek solutions to life’s problems? James addresses these issues in his letter as he seeks to motivate Christians to develop a mature and consistent faith and to show how Christians are to live in their relationship with God and with one another.\nSetting\nJames, Jesus’ brother, became the recognized leader of the Jerusalem church shortly after Jesus’ resurrection. He wrote to Jewish Christians (Jas 1:1) who had been scattered by the persecution which began with the stoning of Stephen (Acts 8:1; 11:19). They lived among the Jews who had previously been “scattered abroad” in the Diaspora (Jas 1:1; see John 7:35). The Diaspora had its origins in the Assyrian dispersion of Israel (the northern kingdom) in 722–721 BC and in the Babylonian exile of Judah (the southern kingdom) in 586 BC. This dispersion later included many Jews who traveled extensively throughout the Greek and Roman empires (Jas 4:13; Acts 13:14; 17:1). By the middle of the first century, there were Jewish communities all over the Greco-Roman world. Jewish Diaspora believers were under pressure from a society that oppressed them economically (Jas 2:6) and abused them for their faith in Jesus Christ (2:7).\nSummary\nThe letter of James is written with a pastoral perspective, and it focuses on ethics more than any other book of the New Testament. The letter contains teachings based on the law as understood through the life and teaching of Jesus (1:25; 2:8). James also reflects Jesus’ own teachings, especially as (later) recorded in Matthew’s “Sermon on the Mount” (Matt 5–7) and Luke’s “Sermon on the Plain” (Luke 6:20-49).\nAuthorship\nThe letter of James was written by one of Jesus’ brothers. Like the other sons of Joesph and Mary (Matt 13:55), James (Greek Iakōbos) bore the name of an Israelite hero: Jacob (Hebrew Ya‘aqob; Greek Iakōb).\nDuring Jesus’ public ministry, neither James nor the other siblings were followers of Jesus. They had even tried to end his ministry and bring him home (Mark 3:20-21; cp. John 7:3-5). After Jesus’ resurrection, James became a believer, presumably after a personal resurrection appearance convinced him that Jesus was the Christ (see 1 Cor 15:7). James was with the others in the upper room when the Spirit was given on Pentecost (Acts 1:14; 2:1-3), and he rose to a position of leadership in the Jerusalem church (see Acts 15:13-22).\nDate and Location of Writing\nThe letter of James is perhaps the earliest book in the New Testament, written after the persecution under Herod Agrippa (AD 44, Acts 12:1-5), yet prior to the council in Jerusalem (AD 49~50). It reflects an early period prior to the conflict over circumcising Gentile converts and before the development of false teachings in other Christian communities. It was a time when synagogue (“meeting,” Jas 2:2) and church (5:14) could be used interchangeably, as could law and word (1:23, 25).\nThat this letter was written from Jerusalem is deduced from information in Acts and Galatians about James’s location (Acts 15:13-22; 21:18; Gal 1:18-19; 2:9, 12). The book contains allusions appropriate to Palestine, including references to the scorching heat (1:11); salty water springs (3:11-12); the cultivation of figs, olives, and grapevines (3:12); the sea (1:6; 3:4); and the early and later rains (5:7).\nLiterary Character\nThe letter of James is written in good Koiné Greek, the common Greek of the Greco-Roman world. It reflects the Hellenistic influences on Galilee and Palestine, as well as the enculturation of Jewish readers in the Diaspora. James writes with grammatical accuracy, has a wide vocabulary, and has an elegant feel for the rhythms and sounds of words. There are clear allusions to the Greek translation of the Old Testament (e.g., 4:6), along with some imagery from the Hellenistic world.\nJames uses many oratorical devices, such as fraternal appeals (1:2; 2:1; 3:1; 4:11), rhetorical questions (2:5; 3:11-12; 4:1), imperative exhortations (1:16; 3:1; 5:16), metaphors and illustrations (2:26; 3:3-5; 4:14), and aphorisms that summarize paragraphs (2:13, 17; 3:18; 4:17).\nMeaning and Message\nJames’s primary concern is for his readers to maintain undivided faith and loyalty toward God (Jas 1:6). James recommends patient endurance (1:3), submission to God (4:7), and sharing in the ministries of the church (5:13-20). These will result in perfection (1:4), honor (4:10), and a glorious life (1:12) at the coming of Jesus Christ (5:8).\nThe Law.  James maintained proper respect for the law of Moses and for Jewish traditions, such as the purification ceremonies conducted after a vow (Acts 21:18-25). James also expressed a sympathetic understanding of the Gentile mission when he concluded that Gentiles could be recognized as Christians without first becoming proselytes to Judaism. In doing so, he alluded to God’s covenant with Noah (Acts 15:19-22; see Gen 9:1-17). In his letter, we find James both upholding the law (Jas 1:25) and at the same time hinting at its reinterpretation through Jesus the Messiah (2:8-11).\nJewishness.  James uses the symbols of Judaism with little criticism and uses the primary identity markers of Judaism without redefinition (contrast Rom 2:29). James addresses the readers as the “twelve tribes” (1:1) and identifies their church gathering as a synagogue (2:2) with elders (5:14) and teachers (3:1). He refers to the law of Moses repeatedly (1:25; 2:8-12; 4:11), cites the foundational creed of Israel (the Shema, 2:19), and names God as “the Lord of Heaven’s Armies” (5:4), a common Old Testament title for God. James also uses the literary elements of Old Testament wisdom literature (1:5; 3:13, 17) and prophetic exhortations (4:13; 5:1). And he appeals to Israelite heroes (Abraham, 2:21, 23; Rahab, 2:25; Job, 5:11; Elijah, 5:17). He does not, however, explicitly mention the ceremonial elements of Judaism, such as the Sabbath, circumcision, or food laws.\nWorks.  The apparent differences between James and Paul regarding “good works” must be understood in their differing historical and theological contexts. Both Paul and James believed that only God, through his initiative of grace, could overcome the problem of human sin. Both Paul and James believed that a person must respond to God’s offer of salvation by faith. But they differed in their emphasis. Paul, who frequently confronted Jewish Christians for the requirements they sought to place upon Gentiles, emphasized that works of the law do not produce salvation (Eph 2:8-9)—people cannot get right with God by “doing what the law commands” (Rom 3:20, 28; Gal 2:16) or, indeed by anything that they might do (Rom 4:3-5). James, meanwhile, emphasizes that good deeds are the evidence of a genuine relationship with God based on faith. True biblical faith will always produce good deeds pleasing to God. James demonstrates that faith cannot be reduced to a mere affirmation of truth (2:19), and faithfulness does not allow for divided allegiance between God and the world (1:8; 4:4, 7).\nOppression.  The letter of James helps us understand how Christians should live when they are a minority group in the midst of an oppressive, non-Christian society. James encourages his readers to endure their trials with fortitude and to exhibit consistent Christian character. The letter is full of godly counsel and wisdom for us today, particularly as we encounter difficulties in society in relation to our faith.",

    "content": "First Peter has the single focus of encouraging Christians to exhibit faithfulness under the pressure arising from persecution. The believers to whom Peter wrote were in the midst of such “fiery trials.” The culture in which they lived scorned their faith, criticized their morality, and mocked their hope. Peter calls on readers to respond to this pressure with a renewed commitment to live out the grace of God, both to please God and to bear witness to him.\nSetting\nMany people in the ancient world regarded Christians as strange, superstitious, and disloyal to Roman society. Christians gathered in secret, practiced strange rituals (such as the Lord’s Supper, widely misunderstood as involving bloody sacrifice), and exhibited a countercultural lifestyle. They often refused to serve in the Roman army because they would not swear an oath to the emperor. Because of their refusal to go along with the prevailing culture, Christians were often discriminated against, accused of misbehavior, and brought into court on trumped-up charges.\nThis is the situation that 1 Peter addresses. Believers were undergoing very difficult trials (1:6; 4:12), and other groups were saying evil things about them (4:4; see 3:16). The followers of Christ were tempted to retaliate in kind and repay harsh words with harsh words. They were also tempted to compromise their godly lifestyle because of the grief it caused them.\nPeter was well aware of these temptations, so his letter encourages believers to view the accusations and unfair treatment as an opportunity to bear witness to Jesus Christ. By following the example of their own Lord, who lived an exemplary life before all and refused to revile those who reviled him, Christians can practice a lifestyle of true evangelism.\nSummary\nAfter a typical opening for a letter (1:1-2), Peter exhorts his readers in the first section (1:3–2:12) to regard their present, temporary suffering as a strengthening of their faith and as preparation for them to receive salvation (1:3-9). This salvation is so great that prophets predicted it and angels investigate it (1:10-12). This gift of salvation should result in a life of holiness that recognizes the cost at which God purchased our salvation (1:13-21). The first section concludes with a call for love and patience toward fellow Christians (1:22–2:3) and a reminder of our status as the new covenant people of God (2:4-12).\nThe second part of the letter (2:13–3:12) exhorts Christians to live under the recognized authorities as a witness to a hostile world. Christians are to accept the authority of government (2:13-17), Christian slaves are to accept the authority of their masters (2:18-25), and Christian wives are to accept the authority of their husbands (3:1-6). Husbands, meanwhile, are to honor their wives (3:7). This section ends with general exhortations to behavior that God rewards (3:8-12).\nThe third section (3:13–4:11) begins with a challenge to respond to social pressures with honorable and respectful behavior, even when it results in abuse (3:13-17). Peter reminds his readers that the hope of redemption is secure because of Christ’s life, death, resurrection, and ascension (3:18-22). Peter renews his call to abandon the ways and values of the world (4:1-6) and concludes with various exhortations (4:7-11).\nThe fourth section of the letter (4:12–5:11) opens with a final call to stand firm in the midst of suffering (4:12-19). Peter then concludes with a charge to elders (5:1-4), younger men (5:5), and the church at large (5:5-11). The letter ends with customary greetings (5:12-14).\nAuthor and Recipients\nThe opening verse of the letter identifies the author as the apostle Peter and the recipients as “God’s chosen people” living in “the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia“.” These Roman provinces occupied the northern portion of Asia Minor, the peninsula that today forms most of Turkey. We have no record of Peter’s visiting this area, nor does the letter indicate such a visit. In fact, we have little information about Peter’s movements and activities after his initial days of ministry in Jerusalem and Judea (Acts 1:1–12:25). Luke tells us that after being miraculously rescued from prison, Peter “went to another place” (Acts 12:17). Speculations abound, but we simply don’t know where he went. Peter was back for the council in Jerusalem (Acts 15:1-41; AD 49~50) and apparently spent some time ministering in Corinth (see 1 Cor 1:12; 9:5). He was also in Antioch at some point (Gal 2:11-16). Christian tradition places Peter in Rome at the end of his life, where he suffered a martyr’s death at the hands of the emperor Nero (probably AD 64 or 65).\nPlace and Date of Writing\nThe apostle was evidently in Rome when he wrote this letter. “Your sister church here in Babylon” (5:13) is almost certainly a reference to the church in Rome. The ancient city of Babylon, well-known from later Old Testament books, was small and insignificant in Peter’s day (the first century AD), and it would be surprising if Peter had ever traveled so far east. But because the ancient city of Babylon had been so dominant in the 600s–500s BC, the name came to symbolize the center of world power and cultural influence. The book of Revelation thus uses Babylon as a code word for Rome (see Rev 17:5), and Peter was probably doing the same. If Peter wrote this letter from Rome, then it was probably written toward the end of his life. This supposition is confirmed by the presence of Mark with Peter (see 1 Pet 5:13). Christian tradition places Mark in Rome with Peter in the late 50s and early 60s AD. We can surmise, then, that Peter wrote this letter from Rome in the early 60s AD.\nOccasion of Writing\nPeter’s letter was motivated by the severe trials that the Christians in northern Asia Minor were experiencing. Attempts have sometimes been made to identify the situation and date of 1 Peter by connecting the letter to a known official persecution. The letter, however, does not suggest that the Christians were being subjected to an official, state-sponsored program of persecution. Most often, pressures came from the general populace, sometimes aided and abetted by local officials.\nMeaning and Message\nFirst Peter encourages Christians to maintain a life of holiness in the midst of the pressures created by the non-Christian, and often anti-Christian, atmosphere in which they live. Peter pursues three key ideas. First, believers must understand that we have experienced the salvation that God promised through his prophets and which the angels are “eagerly watching” (1:12; see 1:5, 10). We are God’s own children (1:14), born again through God’s powerful word (1:23). We are the stones that God is using to construct a new, spiritual temple (2:5) and a chosen people called out of darkness into light (2:9-10). Because we enjoy all these privileges, we have become foreigners and aliens in this world (1:1, 17; 2:12). Christians live in the world but do not belong to the world.\nThe second key idea is that Christians, who are God’s people, need to pursue a lifestyle that embodies the values of heaven, not the values of this world. As God’s children, Christians need to imitate their Father and become holy, as he is holy (1:15-16). We need to love each other (1:22) and have respect for authorities. Peter sums all this up in his call to “do good,” even and especially to those who abuse and cause difficulty (3:16-17; 4:19).\nThe third key idea is that believers have become a holy people because of Christ. Jesus’ death and resurrection provide the foundation for our new identity (1:18-19; 3:18), and his victory over evil powers gives us hope and confidence (1:3-9; 3:19-22). Christ provided for our salvation and our holiness and has also given us an example to imitate. Christ did not retaliate when he was criticized, persecuted, and even executed (2:21-25). We are to follow in his footsteps, refuse to retaliate, and use our trials as an occasion to testify about the grace and power of God.",

    "content": "Many worldviews, religious perspectives, and cultural values clamor for attention. Second Peter urges growth in Christ’s grace and warns against compromising the Christian faith by mixing it with ideas that are foreign to Christianity.\nSetting\nSecond Peter was probably written to the same group of Christians as 1 Peter (1 Pet 1:1; see 2 Pet 3:1). We do not know if Peter ever visited Asia Minor—the New Testament tells us little about his movements after he departed from Jerusalem around AD 44 (Acts 12:16-17). We know that Peter was in Rome in the early 60s AD. Presumably, he wrote 2 Peter from Rome shortly after 1 Peter. Early Christian tradition indicates that Peter died under the emperor Nero in AD 64 or 65.\nSummary\nIn the letter opening (1:1-15), Peter identifies himself and his readers (1:1-2) and introduces his main concern, that his readers will grow in their knowledge of God and of Christ (1:3-11). He also tells them with a sense of urgency that he does not have long to live (1:12-15).\nChapter 2 is the central focus of this letter, where Peter profiles and condemns false teachers. Peter prepares for this denunciation by emphasizing the certainty of Christ’s return in glory (1:16-21). The false teachers were evidently skeptical about Christ’s return and final judgment.\nPeter denounces the false teachers in four stages: He predicts the coming of false teachers (2:1-3), he insists that God will judge them while rescuing the righteous (2:4-10), he declares the false teachers’ sins (2:10-16), and he pronounces their doom (2:17-22).\nAfter further insisting that Christ will, indeed, return in glory to transform the world (3:1-13), Peter concludes the letter as he began, by praying that his readers will “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (3:18; see 1:3-11).\nAuthorship\nThe author identifies himself as Simon Peter (1:1), one of Jesus’ apostles. Peter claims that “this is my second letter to you” (3:1). The first letter was probably 1 Peter.\nIn many ways, however, 2 Peter is unlike 1 Peter, while containing striking similarities to the letter of Jude. Because of this, some interpreters think that someone else wrote 2 Peter. This conclusion is unnecessary because 2 Peter is dealing with a situation very different from 1 Peter; naturally, the language and concepts differ. Moreover, it is possible that Silas (Peter’s scribe mentionedalso called Silvanus in 1 Pet 5:12) was responsible for some of the wording of 1 Peter and that Peter used a different scribe in 2 Peter.\nRelationship to Jude\nIt is undeniable that 2 Peter and Jude have some kind of literary relationship. The two letters use too many of the same unusual expressions for the similarities to be coincidental or a matter of shared oral tradition (cp. 2 Pet 2:3 // Jude 1:4; 2 Pet 2:4 // Jude 1:6; 2 Pet 2:6 // Jude 1:7; 2 Pet 2:10 // Jude 1:8; 2 Pet 2:11 // Jude 1:9; 2 Pet 2:13, 17 // Jude 1:12; 2 Pet 3:3 // Jude 1:8). This relationship can be explained in one of three ways: (1) Jude borrowed from 2 Peter; (2) 2 Peter borrowed from Jude; or (3) both 2 Peter and Jude borrowed from a common literary source now lost. Option 2 is the most popular, although option 1 is equally possible. Option 3 is least likely, simply because it is more complicated and unnecessary. Whichever author did the borrowing was apparently faced with a very similar situation and found what the other had written to be appropriate to his own purposes. Such borrowing was not uncommon in the ancient world; rather than being considered plagiarism, it was considered a compliment.\nFalse Teachers\nThe false teachers that Peter denounces cannot be identified with any known heresy in the ancient church. With their immorality and skepticism, these false teachers assumed that God’s grace gave them the liberty to do anything they wanted to do (2 Pet 2:19-20). They had no use for authority (see 2:10-11). They engaged in illicit sex, excess drinking and eating, and greed (2:13-20). They might have been precursors to the later, second-century Gnostics.\nMeaning and Message\nSecond Peter is dominated by a concern over the presence of false teachers in the church. Although these profligates were claiming to be Christians (2:1, 21-22), Peter leaves no doubt that in reality they were destined for condemnation as rebels against the Lord (2:3, 10). Peter writes this letter to warn his readers to reject these false teachers and their teaching, and to remain faithful to the Good News. This letter is a vital reminder of how dangerous it is to deviate from the truth. The church must always be on guard against those who twist the truth of the Good News and whose lives sadly misrepresent it.",

    "content": "John’s first letter applies John’s testimony about Jesus Christ to the lives of believers. Because Jesus Christ came to offer eternal life, we can know by our experience and behavior that we have eternal life. Because Jesus came to reveal the Father, we can be confident in our relationship with the Father. Because Jesus gives the Spirit to each one who is born again, we can live daily in the Spirit. Just as Jesus called his first disciples to love one another, John calls on believers to put that love into action.\nSetting\nJohn and the other apostles were probably forced to leave Jerusalem by AD 68, if not earlier, due to the mounting persecution against the church and the siege of Jerusalem by Roman armies. Sometime later (probably after AD 70), John migrated to the Roman province of Asia (the western region of modern Turkey) and began a successful ministry, primarily among the Gentiles. By AD 90, John had written his Gospel for these believers.\nSoon after this, some members of the Christian community left to form a rival group. These rivals were a heretical faction that promoted teachings about Jesus Christ that later characterized Gnosticism, such as denying that Jesus was God in the flesh (see 4:1-3). By leaving the fellowship of the apostles, they demonstrated that they did not genuinely belong to God’s family (2:18-19). However, the effects of their false teachings still lingered in the minds of the faithful, so John wrote this letter to clear the air of these falsehoods, to bring the believers back to the basics of the Christian life, and to reinforce their faith.\nJohn may have specifically confronted the form of heresy that was promoted by Cerinthus. Cerinthus taught that Jesus was not born to a virgin but was a normal human being born to Joseph and Mary and was simply more righteous, prudent, and wise than other men. He also taught that at Jesus’ baptism, “the Christ” descended upon him in the form of a dove from the eternal Father; “the Christ” then proclaimed the unknown Father and performed miracles. At last “the Christ” departed from the man “Jesus,” and then Jesus (but not “the Christ”) suffered and died, while “the Christ” remained untouched, inasmuch as he was a spiritual being. John may be explicitly refuting the heresy of Cerinthus or his followers in 5:5-8.\nThis first letter went out to the churches under John’s care (including the churches that are mentioned in Rev 1:11) around AD 85–90.\nSummary\nJohn wrote this epistle to encourage believers in the Roman province of Asia to remain steadfast in Christ, and he denounced those who had not remained in the apostolic fellowship. John stressed that Christians must maintain loyalty to Jesus’ apostles—those who had followed Jesus during his life and had known him personally—in order to safeguard against pseudo-spirituality and heresy. John urged his Christian readers to:\n1. maintain loyalty in fellowship toward the apostles and thus to have fellowship with God, who is light, by living in the light he gives us;\n2. confess their sins to God and thus know the advocacy of Jesus Christ, the righteous one;\n3. esteem Jesus Christ as the Word of life, the Son of God;\n4. love God, who is love, and love other Christians;\n5. remain in Christ, become like Christ, and purify themselves of worldly lusts;\n6. know and experience God personally and understand the truth through the Spirit;\n7. discern false teaching by the aid of the Spirit and recognize the spirit of false prophets and of the antichrist; and\n8. be assured of the hope of eternal life.\nAuthor\nSome scholars have suggested that a Christian elder named John, but not the apostle, was the author of 1–3 John (see 2 Jn 1:1; 3 Jn 1:1). They make this judgment on the basis of a quotation from Papias (bishop of Hierapolis in the province of Asia, AD 100–130), who mentioned John the apostle and then later mentioned John the elder:\nIf anywhere one came my way who had been a follower of the elders, I would inquire about the words of the elders—what Andrew and Peter had said, or what Thomas or James or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples; and I would inquire about the things which Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, are saying. (Eusebius, Church History 3.39.4)\nThis quote has led some to think that Papias was speaking of two different people named John, but that is not necessarily the case. Papias noted what the “elders” (including the apostles, such as John) had said about Jesus and what two of the Lord’s disciples (Aristion and John) were still saying (present tense). The apostle John lived to be a very old man, and Papias had heard him speak in person.\nMost evangelical scholars think that John the apostle and John the elder are the same person. The writing style of John’s Gospel is undeniably similar to that of these three letters. The apostle John was an eyewitness of Jesus and one of the very first to follow him. In John’s Gospel, John is called “the one whom Jesus loved” (John 13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, 20). He was one of the twelve disciples and a very close friend to Jesus. The author’s claim to be an eyewitness is as strong in the letters (see 1 Jn 1:1-4) as it is in the Gospel (John 1:14; 19:35). The author of 1 John claims to have personally heard, seen, and touched the eternal Word made flesh (1 Jn 1:1-4). It is reasonable to conclude that the “elder” of 1–3 John is the apostle John.\nMeaning and Message\nJohn’s first letter is a natural extension of his Gospel. John’s Gospel shows that it was Jesus’ mission to reveal God the Father and to bring believers into union with the Father and the Son through the Spirit. John’s first letter emphasizes how Christians experience God in daily life, as demonstrated by their relationships with the other members of the church community. We must exhibit our love for God by loving one another. This command came straight from Jesus (John 13:34; 15:17), and John repeats it often (1 Jn 2:7; 3:11, 23; 2 Jn 1:5-6). Since God is love, all who claim to know God must love others.\nTo love other Christians, however, does not mean accepting everything they say or all that independent teachers teach. There were people who broke away from the community who were denying that Jesus is the Christ, the unique Son of God, or that he had come as a human being. All such people who deny the true humanity and/or the full deity of Jesus Christ are antichrists. This letter warns strongly against those who teach such heresy and lead Christians away from fellowship with the true apostles of Christ.\nHistory shows that many heretical movements have infiltrated the church, but the truth has withstood these assaults. We need to be wary of teachings that are contrary to the teaching of the apostles; the word of God and the Holy Spirit are our guides.",

    "content": "Second John is the shortest book in the New Testament, containing only thirteen verses. In antiquity, the entire letter would have fit on one sheet of papyrus. The first letter of John elaborated the principles of continuing in the truth, loving fellow believers, and watching out for false teachers. This letter gives us an example of applying these principles to a concrete situation.\nSetting\nThe setting of 2 John is similar to that of 1 John (see 1 John Book Introduction, “Setting”). False teachers had been traveling in Asia Minor, teaching a heresy about Jesus known as Docetism. These deceivers rejected the apostolic teaching that Jesus, the divine Christ, had a physical, human body, and they were persuading others to think the same way. These deceivers were probably the heretics John alludes to in his first letter. Some of the members of the church, influenced by this teaching, had broken away to form a new sect. The apostle John was exhorting the believers in Asia Minor to be strong in their faith, in their grasp of the truth of the apostolic message concerning Jesus Christ, and in their love for one another.\nSummary\nThis personal letter begins with a greeting (1:1-3) and then states the author’s wishes (1:4-11). Above all, John wanted his readers to continue adhering to the truth and to love one another. John warns the believers about false teachers who might come among them, and he encourages them to hold on to the apostles’ teachings concerning Jesus Christ so that they will receive their full reward. At the same time, he commands them not to welcome false teachers into their meetings or their homes or to help them in any way. They should not even wish them well; to do so would be to participate in their heresy. John closes his letter with a promise to visit soon and with greetings from the church.\nAuthor\nSome scholars have thought that the John who penned this letter (1:1) was a different John from the apostle, but there are strong reasons to conclude that John the apostle wrote these letters (see 1 John Book Introduction, “Author”).\nRecipients\nThe recipients of 2 John were identified as a “chosen lady and . . . her children” (1:1). This might refer to a specific woman named Kyria and her biological children (the Greek word kyria, “lady,” can be a proper name). However, it is likely that John was speaking about a particular local church (“the chosen lady”) and its individual members (“her children”; cp. 1 Pet 5:13). If so, 2 John was probably sent to one of the churches under John’s care in Asia Minor.\nMeaning and Message\nThe message of 2 John is twofold. First, the members of the Christian community must love one another (1:5). The outworking of this love follows Jesus’ commands (1:6). Second, John warns the church about false teachers who needed to be exposed, avoided, and shunned.\nMany of the New Testament Epistles were written, at least in part, to deal with some form of heretical teaching. This is true of several of Paul’s letters: Galatians (Gal 1:6), Colossians (Col 2:16-23), 2 Thessalonians (2 Thes 2:1-3), and 1 Timothy (1 Tim 4:1; 6:20-21). Peter wrote his second letter to counter false teachers (2 Pet 2:1-22), and Jude wrote his letter for the same reason (Jude 1:3-4). John’s letters, likewise, were written as antidotes to the poisonous effects of false teachings, such as Gnosticism and Docetism, that were infecting many of the early churches.",

    "content": "This small personal letter provides a window into some issues of leadership and conflict in the early churches. A man named Diotrephes was improperly controlling the church and rejecting the apostle and his emissaries. By contrast, Gaius and Demetrius were two men who remained faithful to the church and to the apostle John.\nSetting\nThe apostle John wrote this letter in the same time period as 1 John and 2 John (see 1 John Book Introduction, “Setting”). Some teachers and leaders, claiming to be spiritual, taught a different doctrine about Christ and did not make the same disciplinary demands upon the members of their churches. They assumed their own authority and refused the authority of John. They also perverted the teaching of the apostles. Diotrephes was one of those who had broken away from the apostolic fellowship (cp. 1 Jn 2:18-19). As a leader in one of the local churches, he rejected John’s authority and refused to accept the teachers John sent to the church. He even excommunicated those in the church who did receive them and provide them with hospitality.\nKnowing the situation, John wrote this letter to Gaius, a faithful member of that church, encouraging him to continue welcoming and hosting John’s emissaries and to remain faithful to John’s teaching and fellowship.\nSummary\nOf all the New Testament letters, 3 John is most typical of personal letters in first-century Greece and Rome. As with other letters of this era, 3 John begins (1:1-4) with an identification of the writer (“the elder”) and the recipient (“Gaius”), followed by a wish for the recipient’s welfare.\nIn the body of this letter (1:5-12), John commends Gaius and reproves Diotrephes. Gaius acted commendably in welcoming the traveling teachers, and they had in turn reported to John that Gaius was living according to the truth. This gave John great joy, and he encourages Gaius to continue demonstrating this kind of hospitality.\nIn contrast to Gaius, a church leader named Diotrephes earned the apostle’s censure (1:9-10). Diotrephes’ love for prestigious leadership caused him to rebuff John’s authority and to persuade others to do the same. Diotrephes even excommunicated those who didn’t follow his own leadership. Gaius is warned not to submit to the aggressive leadership of Diotrephes or be influenced by his bad example.\nJohn then highlights the good reputation of a man named Demetrius (1:12). John’s purpose in doing so is not clear to us today, but it’s possible that he was offering Gaius an alternative to Diotrephes to assume leadership in that community.\nJohn closes the letter by mentioning plans for a future visit and offering greetings (1:13-15).\nAuthor and Date\nThe author of this epistle calls himself simply “the elder” (see 1:1), perhaps reflecting his age, or perhaps conveying his authority with respect to his readers. Church tradition has identified this elder as John the apostle, an elderly man and an elder of the churches in Asia Minor during the last decades of the first century (see 1 John Book Introduction, “Author”). Third John was probably written during the same period as 1 John and 2 John, around AD 85–90.\nMeaning and Message\nJohn’s third letter is concerned with a problem introduced in 1 John: Some church leaders followed false teaching and ignored the authority of the apostles.\nWe cannot claim to love God and the truth if we don’t follow apostolic teaching and if we don’t join in fellowship with God’s church, the members of his family.",

    "content": "The very brief letter of Jude has a single focus: to warn believers against succumbing to false teaching. Jude helps believers in Christ stay true to the faith by painting a grim portrait of deviant teachers. Arrogant, immoral, and greedy, these teachers are destined for the terrible judgment God has in store for all who deny and defy him. Who would want to follow such people to their condemnation? In a world with so many distorted ideas about Christianity, we need to be reminded of the dangers of false teaching.\nSetting\nJude wrote this letter to combat false teachers in the early church. Jude focuses less on what these people were teaching than on the way they were living; at the heart of Jude’s critique is the charge that they were libertines—they assumed that God’s grace revealed in Christ gave them the freedom to do whatever they pleased (1:4). They had no respect for authority (see 1:8-9), and they engaged in many sinful behaviors (1:16, 19). These profligates, who claimed to be followers of Christ (see 1:4), were effectively denying the Lord and were therefore destined for the condemnation of all who rebel against him.\nSummary\nAfter the letter opening (1:1-2), Jude explains the situation prompting his letter (1:3-4): The imminent danger posed by the false teachers required that he write a very different kind of letter from the one he had planned to write.\nIn 1:5-16, Jude elaborates on the character of these false teachers. This section unfolds in an A-B-A’ sequence. Jude first uses three scriptural examples to illustrate the condemnation that the false teachers face (A, 1:5-10). He then cites three more scriptural examples to castigate them for their ungodly attitudes and behavior (B, 1:11-13). At the end of this section, he returns to their condemnation, citing Jewish tradition to hammer home his indictment (A’, 1:14-16).\nJude then appeals directly to his readers (1:17-23), urging them to hold fast to God’s truth and to reach out to believers who might be tempted to follow the false teachers. The letter ends with a notable doxology (1:24-25).\nAuthor\nJude identifies himself as “a brother of James” (1:1). This James is almost certainly the “Lord’s brother” (Gal 1:19; see Matt 13:55 // Mark 6:3), who became the recognized leader of the Jerusalem church (Acts 15:13-21; 21:18) and wrote the letter of James. Jude was therefore also a brother of Jesus (Jude is called “Judas” in Matt 13:55 // Mark 6:3). Jude and the other brothers of Jesus did not follow Jesus during his earthly ministry (John 7:5), but evidently became believers after the Resurrection (see Acts 1:14; 1 Cor 15:7) and traveled to spread the message about the resurrected Lord (1 Cor 9:5).\nDate and Destination\nWe know so little about Jude that we cannot pin down a date or destination for the letter. It was probably written after AD 45, to allow time for the kind of false teaching described here to develop. It was probably written before AD 90, when even a young brother of Jesus would have been old. The close relationship between 2 Peter and Jude suggests that the two might have been written at about the same time (see 2 Peter Book Introduction, “Relationship to Jude”).\nMeaning and Message\nFalse Teachers.  False teachers of many varieties have disturbed God’s people over the years. Jude’s letter is a powerful reminder of their potential to harm the community and offers a stark depiction of their terrible fate. Jude’s description of the false teachers makes dynamic use of the Old Testament and other Jewish traditions. Jude compares the false teachers to the rebellious Israelites in the wilderness (1:5), to the angels who rebelled against God (1:6), and to the sinners of Sodom and Gomorrah (1:7). The false teachers are like Cain (see Gen 4), Balaam (see Num 22–24), and Korah (see Num 16). Like all of these examples, false teachers are rebels against the Lord and will experience his judgment.\nDefending the Faith.  In 1:3, Jude implies that there is a core message in the early church which serves as the basis for Christian belief. Paul assumes the same thing when he urges Timothy to “guard what God has entrusted to you” (1 Tim 6:20; see 2 Tim 1:14).\nTo be a Christian means to have faith in God and love for others; it also means to confess gladly the truth that God has revealed in Jesus Christ. We cannot truly express faith in God unless we acknowledge the truth that he has revealed. For this reason, early Christians, even in the New Testament period, formulated creedal statements to summarize the essentials of Christian truth (e.g., 1 Tim 3:16). These creeds were often crafted to counteract a false teaching.\nIf we are to heed Jude’s call to “defend the faith,” we need to know just what that faith is. Too many Christians spend too much energy in debating nonessential details and too little in learning the essentials well. Only by learning the essentials will the faithful be able to explain their faith to others and to guard Christian truth from false teaching.",

    "content": "John’s Apocalypse is a magnificent and wonderfully designed message of the salvation that is available in Jesus Christ. The book blesses all who ponder it and sternly warns those who oppose Christ and the Good News and those whose Christian walk is shallow. The unfolding drama of the book stretches the imagination while bearing witness to God’s supreme power. Its visions describe the plight of Christians, God’s judgments on their persecutors, and eternal hope and promise for God’s faithful people.\nSetting\nRevelation was probably written in the AD 90s, though it could have been written in the AD 60s. During these periods, Christians experienced increasing pressure and persecution. By the 90s, the Jews had condemned Christianity in their councils at Jamnia (AD 70–85). They then reported Christians to Roman authorities as religious deviants who did not deserve protection under the religious licensing laws that allowed Jews to practice their faith. At the same time, Rome demanded absolute loyalty to the emperor. At that point, there may have been no official persecution in the empire as a whole, but in the pro-Roman province of Asia (modern-day Turkey), those who refused to worship the emperor were prone to face harsh persecution.\nIn the face of such persecution, Revelation dramatically reminds Christians of the source of their hope and vindication and firmly challenges them to remain faithful. The Christians in the province of Asia may have appeared weak and powerless to the world, but Revelation repeatedly reminded them, as it still reminds us, that the God we serve is almighty. God controls history; he has accomplished our salvation and continues to work out his purposes.\nSummary\nRevelation begins in an unusual way, with three separate introductions. John first spells out the visionary nature of the book (1:1-3); there is then a letter salutation (1:4-8) followed by a historical introduction (1:9-11).\nThe book then describes a vision of Jesus (1:12-20). In letters to seven churches in the province of Asia, Christ personally addresses the believers and the life of the churches (chs 2–3). Following these letters, chs 4–5 set the stage for the drama that follows by displaying God’s sovereign majesty and picturing Jesus as both a lion and a lamb.\nThe heart of the book (chs 6–16) describes a drama in three acts of judgment. In the first act (6:1–8:1), Christ opens seven seals that result in seven judgments. This act also contains the first interlude (ch 7), which shows God’s people being protected from harm.\nThe second act portrays seven angels blowing seven trumpets (8:2–11:19) in a second view of judgment on the world. The sixth trumpet is followed by a mysterious second interlude (10:1-10) in which an angel, a little scroll, and seven secretive thunders provide an opening for a bittersweet picture of two witnesses who proclaim God’s message (11:1-14). The final trumpet presents heaven, the coming Kingdom of Christ the Lord (11:15-19).\nFollowing the second act, Revelation shifts to a series of three great signs and symbolic portraits. ch 12 depicts the cosmic battle between good and evil and the birth of the promised deliverer, Christ, whom God rescues from Satan’s destructive intentions (12:1-10). Although defeated, Satan—portrayed as a dragon—continues to create havoc among God’s people (12:11-17). The book next introduces two other beasts, who with the dragon form a false “evil trinity” in the world (ch 13). These evil forces contrast starkly with the Lamb of God and his faithful servants standing on Mount Zion, the place of God’s redemption and rule (14:1-5). Three angels deliver God’s message of coming judgment and the destruction of the evil forces (14:6-20).\nThe third and final act of judgment involves seven plagues (ch 16), which John introduces with a joint song by Moses and the Lamb (ch 15).\nAfter the plagues, John narrates the end of the great prostitute, Babylon (or Rome, ch 17). While the world mourns the passing of this supposed source of security (18:1-19), heaven, the apostles, and the prophets rejoice at its destruction (18:20-24) with songs of God’s victory (19:1-10). God’s enemies have no chance of success against the Lord of lords. The beasts (the power structures of the world) and all who follow them meet their just end in the lake of fire when Jesus destroys his enemies in the battle of Armageddon (19:11-21). While the devil is imprisoned (20:1-3), the saints of God enjoy a respite as they reign with Christ on earth (20:4-6). Despite Satan’s all-out attempt to defeat God in battle, he too is thrown into the lake of fire (20:7-10). All who follow the dragon are judged before the throne of God, and death—humanity’s greatest nemesis—is terminated (20:11-15).\nFinally, John paints a marvelous picture of heaven, stretching the human imagination with design, size, and symbolic images (chs 21–22). These scenes, with their vision of hope, make a fitting conclusion to Revelation and to the entire Bible. The Spirit and the church invite all readers to come and receive God’s eternal promise (22:17). The book closes with the ongoing prayer of those who follow Christ: “Come, Lord Jesus!” (22:20).\nInterpreting Revelation\nThe book of Revelation is an exciting work that has bewildered many readers, perhaps because of its nature as both a prophecy and an apocalypse. John Calvin, the Swiss reformer, wrote commentaries on every book in the Bible except Revelation, which indicates that he wasn’t confident that he fully understood the book. Martin Luther did not think that Revelation taught enough about justification by faith; therefore, he assigned Revelation a sub-canonical status, not viewing it as authoritative for doctrine but only for Christian life. In light of the interpretive difficulties, many Christian teachers follow suit by avoiding the book of Revelation entirely, or only speak about the letters to the churches (chs 2–3).\nThrough the centuries, interpreters have argued over the meaning of Revelation. Some have used their interpretations of the book to categorize as apostate or heretical other Christians who don’t share their views. Others spend months and years searching the book for information about recent and upcoming events. The study materials in this product tend to interpret the visions as reflecting the world and experience of the original churches—situated in the Roman Empire—to whom it was first written. The entire drama and message of the book, however, reveals great treasures to encourage believers of all eras in their faith.\nThe Nature of Revelation\nThe entire Bible is inspired by God (see 2 Tim 3:15-17; 2 Pet 1:20-21). Some books, such as Romans, the historical books, and some of the prophets, primarily address the intellect. Other books, such as the Psalms and other poetical writings, engage the emotions. The book of Revelation, however, appeals to the imagination (as do some Old Testament works, such as Ezekiel and parts of Daniel and Zechariah). Revelation speaks through visions, images, and figurative language rather than logical reasoning. The book sometimes presents the literal and the symbolic in intriguing combinations. It resists being treated as a system of end-times doctrines, as those who have tried to systematize it have often discovered.\nBecause of its nature, reading Revelation requires imagination. It is like entering the realm of dreams with God and discovering that they contain a marvelous message from him. Instead of trying to fit all of Revelation’s scenes into a logical system, readers will benefit from thinking in pictures. For example, when John says that “all the green grass was burned” (8:7) and then later says that the locusts are instructed not to “harm the grass” (9:4), such statements seem contradictory. The incongruity is resolved, however, when we realize that John is describing what he saw in two different visions and that the two visions are not meant to narrate a sequence of events—they are meant to portray God’s message in pictures. Similarly, we read in the vision of heaven that “the Temple of God was opened” (11:19), but later we find “no temple” there (21:22). Again, the focus of each vision is different; readers must not try to read one vision into another but instead concentrate on the main point of each vision on its own terms. Early readers, familiar with the logic of metaphors, understood the nature of picture-thinking. Just as they knew not to read one of Jesus’ parables into another, they avoided trying to systematize or conflate John’s visions.\nApocalyptic Writing\nThrough word pictures and visions, John magnificently transports our minds to the realm of imagination. John was not alone in writing this way—he used a familiar kind of literature to convey his message. These imaginative works are called “apocalyptic” (Greek “uncover”) because they claim to reveal a new vision of reality. Such works were often written during times of great stress and persecution as encouragement. Apocalyptic writings often used symbolic names, numbers, and descriptions as a “code” so that outside readers (particularly enemies) who did not possess the key to the code would not understand the implications of the message. The work would seem to them like double talk or nonsense. In Revelation, for instance, Babylon is used as a code for Rome (17:5-9).\nThe Old Testament contains examples of apocalyptic literature in Daniel and Zechariah (see Daniel Book Introduction, “Daniel as Literature”; Zechariah Book Introduction, “Literary Genre”). In Jewish apocalyptic literature, God is usually pictured as transcendent and fully in control of history, even when the situation might seem bleak to readers. God’s message is usually presented through visions, dreams, or journeys to cosmic or spiritual realms. These revelations gave seers, dreamers, interpreters, and prophets messages of hope and salvation for God’s people and messages of judgment on God’s enemies. The prophets were obliged to share their messages with others—particularly with God’s people, who were under persecution and in distress. Readers understood that the promises of hope would not be fulfilled immediately; these promises were generally expressed as part of a coming cataclysmic judgment in which God would destroy his enemies and bring final bliss to his people. Meanwhile, God’s people were to remain faithful and persevere in the face of suffering, understanding that God would soon deliver them. All of these features find expression in Revelation.\nAs a seer or a visionary, John also refers to his work as a “prophecy” (1:3; 22:7); he does not mean that it is prophecy simply in a predictive sense, but in the Old Testament sense of proclaiming a message from God that is addressed to his people. John’s prophetic visions emphasize that God’s answer to distressing times will not be entirely realized until the end of history and in the coming eternity.\nAuthor\nMany Jewish apocalypses were written after the books that now make up the Old Testament canon were completed, at a time when Jews believed that prophecy had ceased and that the word of the Lord for them was primarily to be found in the Law and the Prophets. These Jewish writers wrote under the names of earlier godly persons such as Ezra, Baruch, Enoch, Isaiah, and even Adam so that their writings would gain credibility and acceptance. These works are called pseudepigrapha (literally “false writings”) because they were written under pseudonyms. Similarly, in the post-apostolic era, fanciful writers and false teachers adopted this practice by using the names of earlier followers of Jesus (such as Peter, James, John, and even Mary) to gain a hearing from Christians.\nBy contrast, the books collected in the New Testament were written under their authors’ own names (see Rom 1:1; 2 Thes 3:17) or were legitimately apostolic even though they do not claim an author by name (e.g., Matthew, Hebrews). The author of Revelation identifies himself simply as John (1:1, 4, 9). In the early church, this John was generally identified as the apostle John, who refers to himself in the Gospel bearing his name as “the disciple Jesus loved” (John 13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7); in his epistles, he calls himself “the elder” (3 Jn 1:1).\nDate of Writing\nJohn received the visions presented in Revelation while he was a political and religious prisoner on Patmos, a rocky island used as a Roman prison off the western coast of Asia Minor near Ephesus (Rev 1:9).\nJohn probably wrote Revelation during the concluding years of Domitian’s reign (AD 94–96) or immediately following (AD 96–99). The eight kings (17:7-11) may refer to the eight Roman emperors from Augustus to Domitian. It is also possible that Revelation was written during the AD 60s, when Nero was persecuting the church and killing Christians.\nDuring these times, Christians were experiencing significant anguish and persecution (2:9, 13; 3:9; 13:7). John called his readers to endurance and faithfulness (13:10).\nRecipients\nThe recipients of Revelation were the churches in the Roman province of Asia (the western part of modern Turkey). The seven cities mentioned in chs 1–3 were joined by a triangular road system forming something like a mail route. These cities all lie in ruins today except for Smyrna, which is now the bustling modern seaport of Izmir, Turkey. The order of the cities in the seven letters is geographical and follows the route a courier probably took as he carried the book to each church to be read.\nMeaning and Message\nRevelation portrays the stark nature of evil while emphasizing how God is always present and at work to accomplish his purposes on behalf of his people. Even evil can only do what God allows (e.g., 6:3-4, 7-8; 13:5-7). Jesus is “the Alpha and the Omega” (1:8), the Lord over all history from beginning to end. Ultimately the powers of evil are futile. Satan has already lost the war (12:12); he can merely imitate and pervert what God does.\nRevelation clarifies that what is done on earth has eternal consequences. God’s suffering servants may sometimes wonder whether Jesus is powerful enough to accomplish God’s purpose of salvation (6:9-10). Despite all the evil in the world, however, Revelation assures readers that the crucified and resurrected Lamb of God is truly the powerful Lion of the tribe of Judah (5:5-6). He is fully worthy to receive our praise (5:12), as he is united with the eternal God (5:13-14). Although the ways of the world result in war, violence, economic imbalance, and death (6:1-8), and although some people seem to profit from alignments with evil (13:15-17), these things will ultimately reap distress and doom (18:9-24). God’s people may be persecuted and die for their faith (13:7), but they will ultimately triumph with Christ (14:1-3) because they have been marked by the seal of God (7:4) and have been granted the white robe of victory (6:11; 7:9). They will have access to their heavenly dwelling (21:7), will continually praise God and the Lamb (7:10), and will live forever (22:5). Revelation reminds readers that the great victory over the powers of evil has already been won at the cross (5:5-6). Armageddon is a desperate act of defiance by a foe who is already defeated. While Satan is allowed to kill the saints (13:7), they have already conquered him through Christ and their own witness (12:11).\nThe message for Christians who suffer at the hands of Satan’s servants is not to weep or be afraid (1:17-18; 5:5) but to endure their suffering faithfully (13:10). With God they will prevail (1:6-7; 11:17-18). People will ultimately be judged by what they do and how they act (20:12), and God will bless those who pay attention to the words of this book (1:3; 22:7). God’s holy people are therefore called to persevere faithfully in order to be victorious (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). Revelation calls them to obey God, maintain their witness (12:17; 22:7), endure patiently (13:10; 14:12), and remain vigilant (16:15; 17:14) in the face of persecution, knowing that cowards will face eternal punishment along with evildoers (21:8).",

    "content": "Adam and Eve\nAdam was the first man, the father of the human race. God created the first couple in his image to populate the earth and rule the created order (Gen 1:26-31). God made Adam from the earth and breathed life into him (2:7); he was to cultivate the garden in which God placed him (2:15), name the animals (2:19-20), and follow God’s instructions (1:28; 2:16-17).\nGod created the first woman as a companion and helper for Adam (2:18-22). Eve’s creation from Adam’s rib portrays the unity that God intended for man and woman in marriage (2:23-25). She is honored as “the mother of all who live” (3:20).\nAfter the serpent deceived Eve into rejecting God’s rule, Adam also rebelled (3:1-6). Their willful disobedience disrupted their relationship (3:7) and separated them from God. God looked for Adam after his rebellion; he and Eve were hiding among the trees, already aware of the alienation (3:8). When God questioned him, Adam blamed Eve and, by implication, God (3:12). Their rebellion brought pain, strained relationships, hardship in governing the earth, and death—physical and spiritual (3:16-19, 22-24). Nonetheless, God provided animal skins to cover Adam and Eve (3:21), and promised that Eve’s offspring would defeat Satan (3:15; see Rom 16:20; Rev 12:1-9; 20:1-10).\nAdam was a historical individual (Gen 4:25; 5:1-5; 1 Chr 1:1; Hos 6:7; Luke 3:38; Rom 5:14; 1 Cor 15:22, 45; 1 Tim 2:13-14; Jude 1:14) who also represents humanity as a whole. God’s mandates (Gen 1:26-30) and curses (3:16-19) affected not only Adam and Eve, but the entire human race. Adam represents separation from God, which all humanity experiences.\nThe apostle Paul contrasted those represented by Adam, the first man, with those who follow Christ, the “last Adam” (Rom 5:12-21; 1 Cor 15:45-50; see also Rom 8:5-11, 20-22). Those represented by Adam live only after his example—they partake of his sin, his alienation from God and God’s creation, and his spiritual death. By contrast, those who follow Christ live by faith in him. They are recreated in Christ’s image and become “new people” who partake of a new creation (see Rom 8:29; 1 Cor 15:49; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15). The barriers Adam and Eve raised are removed by Christ (Rom 5:1; 2 Cor 5:19; Gal 3:27-28; Eph 2:14-16); Christ restores what they lost.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:26-31; 2:4–3:24; 4:25–5:5; Hos 6:6-7; Luke 3:38; Rom 5:12-21; 1 Cor 15:22, 45-49; 1 Tim 2:13-14",

Lamech might have hoped that Noah (whose name means “rest” or “relief”) would ease the curse of hardship in working the ground. Instead, God used Noah to help relieve the world of evil.\nGod intended to destroy creation because of pervasive human wickedness (Gen 6:1-7; see Matt 24:37-39; Luke 17:26-27), but he decided to preserve Noah (Gen 6:8). God gave Noah, a righteous and blameless man (Gen 6:9), precise instructions for building the ark in which only the eight people of his family would be saved, along with every kind of creature (Gen 6:14–8:19). When Noah and his family finally emerged from the ark after the flood, Noah pleased God by building an altar and sacrificing burnt offerings. God promised that he would never again flood the whole earth or disrupt the sequence of the seasons, despite human sin (Gen 8:20–9:17).\nNoah’s sons were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. All the nations of the earth descended from them (Gen 9:18-19). When Noah became drunk on wine from his vineyard, his sons and their descendants were cursed or blessed in accord with how they responded to him (Gen 9:20-27). Noah lived for 950 years, including 350 years after the flood (Gen 9:28-29). He is an example of righteousness, obedience, courage, and faith (see Ezek 14:12-20; Heb 11:7; 2 Pet 2:5).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 5:28–10:1; 1 Chr 1:4; Isa 54:9; Ezek 14:12-20; Matt 24:37-38; Luke 3:36; 17:26-27; Heb 11:7; 1 Pet 3:20-21; 2 Pet 2:5",

    "content": "Melchizedek\nMelchizedek is a mysterious biblical personality whose name means “king of righteousness.” He was a Canaanite priest and king; there is no record of his family or of the beginning or end of his life.\nAbraham met Melchizedek after defeating four Mesopotamian kings. The Mesopotamians had raided Sodom and Gomorrah and captured Abraham’s nephew Lot (Gen 14:1-16). When Abraham returned from battle, Melchizedek, king of Salem (=Jerusalem; see Ps 76:2 and footnote there), was with the grateful kings of the Dead Sea confederacy. When Melchizedek gave Abraham bread, wine, and his blessing, he was acting as “a priest of God Most High” (Gen 14:18), the true God who created heaven and earth (see Pss 7:17; 47:2; 57:2; 78:56). Melchizedek correctly understood that Abraham worshiped the true God, and he praised God for giving victory to Abraham (Gen 14:19-20). Abraham received Melchizedek’s gifts and gave him a tithe, which demonstrated the prominence of Melchizedek (see Heb 7:4-10).\nWhile Genesis gives genealogies for many of its characters, Melchizedek appears suddenly without any such record, and he disappears just as quickly. Much later in Israel’s history, King David was perhaps reflecting on this when he said that the Messiah is “a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek” (Ps 110:4; cp. Heb 7:15-25). The book of Hebrews picks up on this notion that Melchizedek had no genealogical record and uses it to compare the temporary Levitical priesthood with the eternal priesthood of Christ. The book of Hebrews also explains that Melchizedek is remembered as “resembling the Son of God” (Heb 7:3), but was not himself the Son of God. His priesthood lasts forever as an archetype that prefigures the Messiah’s priesthood. Like Melchizedek (but unlike the kings of Israel), Jesus is a king who also fulfills priestly functions.\nMelchizedek, a royal priest, was superior to Levi, the ancestor of Israel’s priests. In the same way, the Messiah, Jesus Christ, is a better priest than the descendants of Aaron. Jesus provides permanent atonement for sins and direct access to his Father (Heb 7:24-28). He guides his people by the Spirit rather than by law (Heb 8:7-13) and lives forever as priest and king for those who trust in him.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 14:17-20; Ps 110:4; Heb 5:6-10; 6:20–7:28",

    "content": "Hagar\nHagar was the Egyptian servant of Sarai, Abram’s wife. When God commanded Abram to leave Mesopotamia, he promised him a multitude of descendants who would be given a new land (Gen 12:2, 7). After ten childless years in Canaan, Sarai followed a customary Mesopotamian practice by giving Hagar to Abram as his concubine; any son born of the union of husband and concubine was considered the wife’s child (cp. 30:1-8).\nHagar got pregnant and became disrespectful to Sarai during her pregnancy. Sarai responded by dealing harshly with her, and Hagar fled into the desert (16:4-6). The angel of the Lord appeared to her at a desert well, telling her to return to Abram’s house and submit to Sarai.\nHagar bore a son, Ishmael, when Abram was eighty-six years old (16:1-16).\nFourteen years later, God gave Abraham and Sarah their promised son, Isaac. When Isaac was weaned (at about three years), a traditional feast was held. At this event, Ishmael mocked Isaac (21:9), so Sarah insisted that Abraham send Hagar and Ishmael away. God affirmed this action (21:12), so Hagar and Ishmael were sent away to wander in the wilderness of Beersheba. When their water was gone, God miraculously rescued them and assured Hagar that Ishmael would father a great nation (21:17-19).\nPaul made an analogy (Gal 4:22-31) in which Hagar represents Mount Sinai, where the old covenant was formed, while Sarah represents the heavenly Jerusalem, the community of those who receive salvation by faith in Christ. As Isaac was Abraham’s son by faith in the divine promise, Christians who are free of the law are spiritual children of Sarah.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 16:1-16; 21:9-21; 25:12; Gal 4:22-31",

    "content": "Ishmael\nIshmael was Abraham’s first son, born of Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian servant. The boy was born near Hebron when Abraham was eighty-six years old (Gen 13:18; 16:16). God had promised to make a great nation of the childless Abraham (12:2) and assured him that he would have a son to be his heir (15:4). Ishmael was born in Abraham’s attempt to fulfill God’s promise by human means (see 16:1-16; Gal 4:23), but God would nevertheless accomplish his purposes through Sarah (see Gen 17:15–18:15; 21:1-7).\nWhen God announced that Sarah would have a son to fulfill the promise (17:15-16), Abraham asked God to accept Ishmael (17:17-18). Ishmael was not the promised son—the covenant would be established with Isaac (17:19)—but God did bless Ishmael and make him the father of a great nation (17:20-21).\nAt age thirteen, Ishmael was circumcised in accordance with God’s covenant with Abraham (17:9-14, 23-27). Later, at Isaac’s weaning celebration (when Ishmael was about seventeen), Ishmael made fun of Isaac (21:9), and Abraham sent Ishmael and Hagar away with provisions. The angel of God helped Hagar survive in the wilderness, and Ishmael became a wild game hunter. He settled in the wilderness of Paran and married an Egyptian woman (21:20-21). He assisted in Abraham’s burial (25:9-10), gave his daughter Mahalath in marriage to Esau (28:9), and died at age 137 (25:17). His twelve sons are named in Genesis 25:13-15.\nPaul alluded to Ishmael when urging the Galatians to put their faith in God rather than in the law (see Gal 4:21-31). Those who trust the law will not inherit the kingdom, just as the slave woman’s son did not inherit with the son of the free woman (Gal 4:30).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 16:11-16; Gen 17:18-26; 21:8-21; 25:9-18; 28:9; Gal 4:21-31",

    "content": "Sarah\nSarah was Abraham’s wife and half sister (Gen 11:29; 20:12). She accompanied Abraham from Ur to Haran to Canaan (11:31; 12:5). On two occasions, in Egypt (12:10-20) and Gerar (20:1-18), Abraham asked Sarah to say that she was his sister rather than his wife because he was afraid that he would be killed as her husband. In both cases, despite Abraham’s lack of faith, God protected Sarah, thus preserving the chosen line through whom he promised to multiply the Israelite nation (12:2; 17:19).\nSarah is one of several women in Scripture who were barren but miraculously bore a son (see also Gen 30:22-24; 1 Sam 1:9-20; 2 Kgs 4:14-17; Luke 1:5-25). After a series of promises from God, Sarah eventually conceived and gave birth to Isaac. Because Sarah was ninety years old when this happened (cp. Gen 17:17; 21:1-5), she testifies to God’s ability to do what is humanly impossible. Her name Sarai was changed to Sarah on one of the occasions when Isaac’s birth was promised (17:15-16). Sarah is honored for her faithfulness, even though she laughed at the prediction of Isaac’s birth (18:10-15), twenty-five years after God’s original promise to Abraham.\nSarah died at age 127 and was buried in the cave that Abraham purchased (Gen 23) at Machpelah. She is known as the mother of the nation of Israel (Isa 51:2), just as Abraham is its father. She is a key player in accounts of Abraham’s faith (see Rom 4:19). She represents the freedom that Christians have (as children of Sarah the free woman) through faith in Christ (see Gal 4:21-31). Peter cites her as an example of holy submission (1 Pet 3:5-6). The writer of Hebrews presents Sarah as an example of faith, for she believed in God’s ability to keep his promises (Heb 11:11-12). Her life demonstrates that God is indeed faithful, though his timing may not always match our expectations.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 11:29-31; 12:10-20; Gen 17:15-22; 18:9-15; 20:1-18; 21:1-13; 23:1-20; Isa 51:2; Rom 4:19; 9:6-9; Gal 4:21-31; Heb 11:11-12; 1 Pet 3:6",

    "content": "Lot\nLot was Abraham’s nephew and the ancestor of the Moabites and Ammonites. Like Abraham, Lot was born in Ur and accompanied Terah to Haran (Gen 11:27-32). After Terah’s death, he joined Abraham in journeying to Canaan and Egypt.\nWhen Lot and Abraham returned from Egypt to Canaan, their flocks and herds grew too numerous for them to live together, so Abraham gave Lot his choice of land on which to settle. Lot chose the fertile plain of the Jordan that was like “the garden of the Lord” (Gen 13:10), and eventually he took up residence in Sodom. Lot’s increasing involvement with the completely corrupt cities of the plain compromised him.\nWhile Lot lived in Sodom, four Mesopotamian kings defeated the kings of five towns in the area; in the subsequent plundering, they carried off Lot, his family, and his possessions (Gen 14:1-12). When word of this reached Abraham, he launched a rearguard action against the invaders and recovered the prisoners and property (14:13-16).\nBecause of the wickedness of Sodom and the neighboring city of Gomorrah, God decided to destroy these towns. He sent two angelic visitors to Lot in Sodom to encourage his departure from the doomed city (Gen 19:1-15). The city’s depravity became even more evident in an attempted homosexual attack on the visitors. Lot’s willingness to sacrifice his daughters, along with his reluctance to leave Sodom, shows how corrupt and compromised he had become. No one but his immediate family accompanied him, and his wife was destroyed when she turned back in disobedience. Soon after the destruction of Sodom, Lot’s daughters, despairing of having no husbands, got Lot drunk enough to have sexual relations with them. Their two sons, Moab and Ben-ammi, were ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites (Gen 19:30-38), two nations that became inveterate enemies of Israel (see Deut 23:3-6). Despite Lot’s waywardness, Peter declares that Lot was a “righteous man who was tormented in his soul by the wickedness he saw and heard day after day” (see 2 Pet 2:6-9). This analysis of Lot may stem from Jewish interpretive tradition, as it is difficult to see in the Genesis account.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 11:27, 31; 12:4-5; 13:1-14; 14:12-16; 19:1-38; Deut 2:9, 17-19; Ps 83:4-8; Luke 17:28-33; 2 Pet 2:6-9",

    "content": "Isaac\nThe name Isaac means “he laughs,” reflecting the circumstances of his birth. When God promised that Isaac would be born, both Abraham and Sarah first laughed in disbelief (Gen 17:15-19; 18:9-15). God had promised Abraham a son (15:4-6), but no son had come, and Abraham and Sarah were beyond childbearing age. So at Isaac’s birth, they laughed for joy (21:6-7).\nDuring Isaac’s adolescence, God tested Abraham by telling him to sacrifice Isaac (22:1-19). Abraham’s faith remained firm; he obeyed, and Isaac submitted to his father. God then intervened to provide a sacrificial ram in Isaac’s place. Abraham’s faith in God was rewarded with the promise of great blessings (22:15-18).\nIsaac married Rebekah and was ready to carry on the chosen line, but Rebekah was unable to bear children (25:21). Rather than take matters into his own hands as his father had done (see 16:1-16), Isaac “pleaded with the Lord” and Rebekah bore twin sons. Isaac favored Esau, the older son, while Rebekah preferred Jacob. This favoritism led to Isaac’s being deceived by his son Jacob when he was old and blind (27:1-40). Favoritism remained a problem among Isaac’s descendants (see 29:30; 33:1-2; 37:4).\nIsaac followed his father Abraham’s example in relating to surrounding nations. When visiting another kingdom during a famine, he fearfully claimed that his wife was his sister (26:1-11; cp. 12:10-20; 20:1-18). Like his father, Isaac became prosperous in that land and was asked to leave (26:12-16; cp. 12:16-20); he experienced conflict over water and land with other herdsmen (26:17-22; cp. 21:25-31); and he made a treaty with the king of the Philistines (26:26-31; cp. 21:22-32).\nIsaac was given the same promise that his father had received (26:2-5, 23-25; cp. 22:16-18), and he demonstrated his participation by carrying on the practice of circumcision, which signified the covenant (see Acts 7:8). As the child of promise, Isaac represents all who are children of Abraham by faith in Christ and are thereby free to live as God’s children rather than as slaves (see Gal 4:21–5:1).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 17:19-21; 21:1-12; 22:1-19; 24:1-8, 14, 62-67; 25:5-11, 19-28; 26:1–28:9; 31:42; 35:12, 27-28; 48:15-16; 49:31; Exod 3:6; Josh 24:3-4; Rom 9:6-10; Gal 4:21-31; Heb 11:8-9, 17-20",

    "content": "Hittites\nThe Hittites were once unknown to secular history and thought to be a mythical people by some critics of biblical history. But information about the Hittites has been uncovered by archaeologists and historians, and they are now known to have had an empire centered in Asia Minor, with their capital at Hattusha (modern Baghazkoy). At times the empire extended over a much larger area without definite boundaries since it included city-states that were dependencies by treaty. They were of sufficient military strength to challenge the armies of Egypt under the vainglorious Rameses II (1279–1213 BC) and fought him to a standstill at Kadesh on the Orontes (ca. 1274 BC). In patriarchal times, the Hittites held power in cities like Hebron in Canaan.\nThe progenitor of the Hittites, Heth, is listed second among the sons of Canaan in the “table of nations” (Gen 10:15; see also 1 Chr 1:13 and the textual footnote there). Most of the references to the sons of Heth appear in the narrative of the purchase of the cave of Machpelah by Abraham (Gen 23). Later, God commanded the people of Israel to destroy all the Hittites living in the Promised Land (Deut 7:1-2), but Israel did not completely do so (1 Kgs 9:20-21). Some of David’s best warriors were from Hittite ancestry (1 Sam 26:6; 2 Sam 11–12), and Solomon engaged in trade with Hittite kings (1 Kgs 10:29–11:1). The Bible thus suggests that the Hittites were a people of great consequence.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 23:3-20; 26:34-35; 27:46–28:2; Deut 7:1; 1 Sam 26:6; 2 Sam 11:2-27; 1 Kgs 9:20",

    "content": "Rebekah\nGenesis 24 describes the mission of Abraham’s servant to find a wife for Isaac. At Abraham’s command, he went to Haran in Aram-naharaim (northwest Mesopotamia), to Abraham’s relatives, because Abraham did not want Isaac to marry a local Canaanite. The servant prayed that the young woman God had selected to be Isaac’s wife would answer his request for a drink by immediately giving it and watering his camels as well (24:12-14). This would not only serve to confirm God’s will in the matter but would also demonstrate her character, hospitality, and work ethic.\nGod decisively answered his prayer with Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel (22:23; 25:20), the son of Abraham’s brother Nahor (24:24).\nWhen Abraham’s servant described how God had led him (24:34-49), Rebekah’s family recognized it as God’s hand, but they were reluctant to let her go immediately (24:50-56). Rebekah, however, demonstrated faith in God’s plan; she was willing to leave her family without delay to marry Isaac (24:57-58). Rebekah’s faith was richly rewarded; the blessing her family gave her in parting (24:59-60) came true when she bore to Isaac the next generation of God’s chosen line.\nRebekah bore twins, Esau and Jacob (25:20-26). She preferred Jacob, the younger son, who God had told her would be the stronger one and the leader of the two (25:23). Rebekah helped Jacob seize the blessing of the firstborn by deceiving Isaac (27:1-40). Afterward, she arranged for Jacob to be sent to Haran to get away from his brother’s resulting anger (27:41–28:5). Rebekah’s deceptive scheme created a lasting schism in the family, and she apparently never saw her favorite son again. She was, however, buried with Isaac in the family burial site (49:31), and she fulfilled God’s plan as the mother of Jacob, the founding father of Israel.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 22:23; Gen 24:12-67; 25:20-28; 26:7-8, 35; 27:5-17, 42-46; 29:12; 35:8; 49:31; Rom 9:10-13",

    "content": "Esau\nEsau, the son of Isaac and Rebekah, was Jacob’s older twin brother (Gen 25:24-26), so named because his body was hairy at birth. His descendants were called Edomites (“Edom” meaning “red”) on account of his reddish color at birth (25:25), the red lentil stew he received from Jacob (25:30), and the reddish color of the land in which he settled (see study note on Gen 25:25).\nEsau was a proficient hunter who brought tasty wild meat to his father. Isaac enjoyed its strong flavor more than the mild meat Jacob provided from the family flocks. One day Esau returned home very hungry from an unsuccessful hunt, and Jacob persuaded Esau to surrender his birthright in exchange for food (25:29-34). Esau had little regard for his birthright and was controlled by his carnal desires (see Heb 12:16). He also married two local women who were not Abraham’s descendants (Gen 26:34-35), which may have fed into Rebekah’s favoritism toward Jacob and her idea about stealing the blessing of Isaac that was intended for Esau (27:1-40). Esau’s anger on discovering his brother’s deception prompted Jacob to flee for Haran. The brothers were reunited twenty years later when Esau demonstrated gracious forgiveness (33:1-16).\nEsau was born with Jacob grasping his heel; this omen was interpreted to mean that Esau’s descendants would be subject to Jacob’s offspring. The subservient relationship between the Edomites and the Israelites began in David’s time (2 Sam 8:11-15; 1 Chr 18:11-13) and continued until the reign of Jehoram (2 Kgs 8:20-22; 2 Chr 21:8-10). Following a rebellion in 845 BC, the Edomites briefly gained their independence but were conquered again by Amaziah (796–767 BC). They regained their freedom in 735 BC and then remained independent of Judah.\nIn the New Testament, Esau represents the line of Abraham’s descendants who lacked the gift of faith and were rejected by God as recipients of his promised blessings (see Rom 9:6-24). Herod the Great was an Edomite.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 25:21-34; 26:34-35; 27:1-42; 28:6-9; 32:3-20; 33:1-16; 35:28-29; 36:1-43; Deut 2:1-8, 12, 22, 29; Josh 24:4; Mal 1:2-5; Rom 9:6-13; Heb 11:20; 12:16-17",

He first met her as he arrived at Paddan-aram in Haran, when he helped her remove the stone from a well and watered her father’s sheep (Gen 29:10). Jacob agreed to work seven years for Laban in order to have Rachel as his wife, and the time seemed like only a few days because of his great love for her.\nLaban deceptively required Jacob to marry Leah, his older, less attractive daughter, before finally giving him Rachel. Unlike Leah, Rachel was barren in the early years of her marriage to Jacob (29:31; 30:1). She gave her servant Bilhah to Jacob in order to have children by her, and Dan and Naphtali were born (30:3-8). In time, Rachel conceived and bore Joseph (30:22-24), and soon after, Jacob took his wives, children, and possessions away from Haran.\nSomewhere between Bethel and Bethlehem, Rachel died while giving birth to Benjamin (35:16-20). Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb that was a landmark even in Saul’s time (1 Sam 10:2). Rachel and Leah are highly regarded for having built up the house of Israel (Ruth 4:11). In Jeremiah 31:15, Rachel is pictured as crying for her children being carried off into captivity, and Matthew recalls Jeremiah’s words at Herod’s slaughter of the male infants around Bethlehem shortly after Jesus’ birth (Matt 2:16-18).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 29:6–30:24; 31:4-19, 31-35; 33:1-7; 35:16-20; 46:19-22; 48:7; Ruth 4:11; 1 Sam 10:2; Jer 31:15; Matt 2:18",

He fell in love with his cousin Rachel and arranged with her father to marry her after seven years of work (29:17-20). After the wedding feast, Laban deceived Jacob by giving him Leah instead of Rachel (29:21-25), claiming that custom required the older daughter to marry first (29:26). Leah was less attractive than her sister (29:17), and Jacob did not love her (29:30-35).\nJacob’s love for Rachel induced him to work another seven years to marry her. Because Jacob favored Rachel, the Lord blessed Leah with six sons and a daughter (Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, and Dinah) before Rachel was able to conceive (29:31–30:22). At one point Rachel bargained with Leah for some mandrakes, a plant believed to ensure conception, in exchange for conjugal rights. Leah then conceived and bore her fifth son (30:14-17), increasing her advantage in her rivalry with Rachel.\nLeah was the mother of two tribes that played particularly significant roles in Israelite history. The tribe of Levi was the tribe of the priesthood, and the tribe of Judah became the tribe of royalty through which the promised seed (Gen 3:15; 12:2-3; 2 Sam 7:16; Matt 1:1) came in the person of Jesus Christ.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 29:14-35; 30:9-21; 31:4-16; 33:1-7; 34:1; 46:8-15; 49:31; Ruth 4:11",

    "content": "Joseph\nJoseph is known for his dreams and for the beautiful coat his father, Jacob, gave him. He is an example of faith, prudence, and administrative ability. Despite overwhelming difficulties, Joseph saved Canaan, Egypt, and his own family from starvation during seven years of drought.\nJoseph was Jacob’s eleventh son, the first child of Jacob’s favorite wife, Rachel. Joseph’s name means “may he add,” expressing Rachel’s desire that God give her another son (Gen 30:24). Rachel later died at the birth of Benjamin, Joseph’s only full brother.\nJoseph’s brothers resented him because of his dreams. They sold him to a passing caravan and led Jacob to believe an animal had killed him. In Egypt, Joseph quickly rose in prominence, until he was jailed when his master’s wife falsely accused him. In prison he correctly interpreted dreams for fellow inmates and was later summoned when Pharaoh couldn’t understand his own dreams. Joseph interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams—which were about an upcoming famine—with insight and wisdom, so Pharaoh released him (thirteen years after he had been brought to Egypt as a slave) and appointed him to lead the nation in preparation for the famine. When Joseph’s brothers had to buy grain in Egypt, they appeared before him, but they did not recognize him. Later, their remorse and Judah’s intercession provoked Joseph to disclose his identity. The family was reconciled and reunited when Jacob came to live in Egypt.\nBecause Jacob blessed Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, and took them as his own (48:5-20), each was considered a separate tribe later in Israel. Ephraim, whom Jacob put first and to whom he gave the birthright (48:17-20), became one of the strongest tribes of Israel and the leading tribe in the northern kingdom after the division during Rehoboam’s reign (see 1 Kgs 11:26–12:33). Several of the prophets refer to the northern kingdom under the names Ephraim (e.g., Ezek 37:15-19; Hos 5:3-5) and Joseph (e.g., Obad 1:18).\nJoseph had faith that the Israelites would someday return to the land God had promised them, so his dying wish was that his bones be buried in Canaan when they left Egypt (Gen 50:24-26; see Exod 13:19; Josh 24:32). Joseph’s story dramatizes the life of a man of faith and godly character who fulfilled God’s plan. His name is mentioned frequently in Scripture, showing that he was highly regarded by later Israelites. His story is summarized in the Psalms (Ps 105:16-22) and in Stephen’s speech just prior to his martyrdom (Acts 7:9-14).\nJoseph’s life confirms God’s control of the long course of history even when bad things happen (Gen 50:20). God expresses his sovereign power through his provident, faithful love for his people. Joseph also models for us a firm faith in the sovereign God and personal integrity in the face of adversity.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 30:22-24; 37:2-36; 39:1–45:28; 48:1-22; 49:22-26; 50:1-26; Exod 13:19; Deut 33:13-17; Josh 24:32; Ps 105:16-22; Acts 7:9-14",

    "content": "Judah\nJudah is remembered most often as the ancestor of King David and of Jesus Christ. Despite his birth as a middle child and his sins as an adult (Gen 38), God chose Judah to carry the line of King David (1 Chr 2:1-17; 3:1-24) and of the Messiah (Gen 49:8-12; Matt 1:1-16; Luke 3:23-34).\nJudah was the fourth of Jacob’s twelve sons (Gen 35:23; 1 Chr 2:1). Leah, overjoyed to have borne her fourth son, named him Judah, meaning “praise” (Gen 29:35). Judah fathered five sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah by Bathshua, a woman from Canaan (Gen 38:1-5; 1 Chr 2:3); and the twins, Perez and Zerah, by his daughter-in-law Tamar (Gen 38:27-30; 1 Chr 2:4). God killed his first two sons, Er and Onan, in Canaan for disobedience (Gen 46:12). Judah eventually settled his family in Egypt with his father and brothers (Exod 1:1-2).\nThough reckless in his behavior with Tamar (Gen 38:6-30), Judah took personal responsibility for Benjamin’s safety in Egypt and interceded with Joseph for his brothers (44:14-34). When Jacob gave his dying blessing, he granted Judah a position of leadership; the future kings of Israel would come through Judah’s offspring (see 49:10).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 29:35; 37:26-27; 38:1-30; 43:1-10; 44:14-34; 46:28; 49:8-12; Ruth 4:12; 1 Chr 2:3-4; 5:2; Ps 108:8",

    "content": "Abraham\n“By faith . . . Abraham obeyed when God called him to leave home and go to another land. . . . He went without knowing where he was going. . . . By faith . . . Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God was testing him” (Heb 11:8, 17). These key events in Abraham’s life illustrate the faithful obedience for which he is best known.\nGod called Abram from the city of Ur to become the patriarch of God’s people. Abram’s family relationships are recorded in Genesis 11:26-32. Terah had three sons: Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Terah left Ur with Abram, Abram’s wife Sarai, and Lot, whose father, Haran, had died. On his way to Canaan, Terah settled in the city of Haran (11:31). God had called Abram to a new land while he was still in Ur (Acts 7:2-4). God told Abram, “Leave your native country, your relatives, and your father’s family, and go to the land that I will show you” (Gen 12:1). God blessed Abram by making a covenant with him that included promises of great blessing, numerous descendants, and a new land (12:1-3). These promises later saved Israel from destruction when they repeatedly failed to keep their covenant with God (see Lev 26:40-45).\nAbram left Haran at age seventy-five. Entering Canaan, he went first to Shechem, a Canaanite city between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. God appeared to Abram near the oak of Moreh, likely a Canaanite shrine. Abram built altars there and near Bethel (Gen 12:6-8), proclaiming the one true God at these centers of false worship. Abram later moved to Hebron by the oaks of Mamre, again building an altar to worship God (13:18).\nWhen God again promised blessings to Abram in a vision (15:1), Abram exclaimed that he was still childless because Sarai was barren (11:30) and that Eliezer of Damascus was his heir (15:2). This obscure statement is clarified by the Nuzi documents, discovered at the site of the ancient Mesopotamian city of Nuzi. According to Hurrian custom, a childless couple of means could adopt an heir, often a slave who would be responsible for their burial and mourning. However, a natural son born after the slave-heir’s adoption would supplant him. Apparently Abram had adopted Eliezer in this manner, but God promised that Abram’s own son would be his heir (15:4).\nThe hallmark of Abram’s life was that he believed the Lord, and the Lord considered him righteous because of his faith (Gen 15:6; see Rom 4:3; Gal 3:6; Jas 2:23). Abram was declared righteous not because he was sinless. On several occasions he failed to do what was right—twice he lied about Sarai out of fear, and he took the provision of a son into his own hands with Hagar rather than continuing to wait for God to act (Gen 16:1-5). But he consistently returned to faith as the fundamental principle of his life before God.\nAbram was eighty-six years old when Ishmael was born to Sarai’s servant Hagar. When Abram was ninety-nine, the Lord appeared to him and reaffirmed his covenant promise of a son and of blessing (Gen 17), adding circumcision as the mark of the covenant relationship (17:9-14). God also changed Abram’s and Sarai’s names to Abraham and Sarah (17:5, 15). Abraham laughed at the promise of another son (17:17). Shortly afterward, the Lord appeared again to Abraham (18:1-15) and again announced the promised son. This time, Sarah was caught laughing in disbelief (18:10-15). Abraham was one hundred years old and his wife was ninety when the Lord did “exactly what he had promised” (21:1). The long-promised son was born and was fittingly named Isaac (“he laughs!”).\nThe supreme test of Abraham’s faith came when God commanded him to sacrifice Isaac (22:1-19). Abraham obeyed faithfully, trusting that God would not thwart his own purposes (see Heb 11:17-19). Just as the knife was about to fall, the angel of God stopped Abraham and provided a ram for him to sacrifice in Isaac’s place. Abraham’s faith was complete (22:10-13).\nChristians understand the sacrifice of Isaac as prefiguring God’s provision of his only Son, Jesus Christ, as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. God has fulfilled his covenant with Abraham through Jesus Christ, through whom the blessing of salvation is extended to all who have faith (Rom 4:16-17), making believers Abraham’s spiritual descendants (Gal 3:29). Abraham’s life shows that God is faithful and worthy of belief and obedience. The full import of God’s promise was realized when the gospel was preached to all nations and people from all families of the earth responded in faith (see Gal 3:6-9).\nAbraham was called God’s friend (2 Chr 20:7; Jas 2:23). All who live by faith are challenged to live as he did, daily venturing into the unknown with trust in God’s guidance and sustenance. Abraham is one of many great “witnesses” to a life of faith (Heb 12:1; see Heb 11), inspiring believers to persevere in faith because we know God is faithful.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 11:26–25:11; 26:2-5; Exod 3:15-16; 6:3; 32:13; Josh 24:2-3; 1 Chr 1:27-34; 2 Chr 20:7; Isa 29:22; 41:8; 51:1-2; Ezek 33:24; Matt 1:1-2; 3:9; 8:11; 22:31-33; Luke 16:19-31; John 8:31-58; Acts 7:2-8; Rom 4:1-23; 9:5-9; 11:16-17; Gal 3:6-29; Heb 6:13-15; 11:8-12, 17-19; Jas 2:21-23",

    "content": "Jacob\nJacob, the younger twin son of Isaac and Rebekah, struggled with his twin brother Esau in the womb and was born grasping Esau’s heel (Gen 25:21-26). God told Rebekah that the boys represented two nations and that the older son would serve the younger (Gen. 25:23).\nIsaac favored Esau, an outdoorsman; Rebekah preferred Jacob, who was happier at home. Once, Esau returned famished from hunting and Jacob bought his birthright with some red stew he had cooked (Gen 25:27-34; see Heb 12:16). Some time later, Isaac asked Esau to prepare wild game so he could eat and bless him (Gen 27:1-4; cp. 25:28). But Rebekah sent Jacob to deceive Isaac into blessing him instead, and her ploy was successful (27:5-29). Jacob’s ruse was soon discovered (27:30-35), but legally, valid blessings were irrevocable promises (27:33). So Isaac gave Esau a lesser blessing (27:36-40), and Esau plotted to kill Jacob (27:41). Rebekah convinced Isaac to send Jacob away to her brother Laban so that Jacob would marry among relatives (27:42-46).\nSo Isaac transferred the covenant promises to Jacob and sent him to Haran (28:1-5). Along the way, God appeared to Jacob in a dream and affirmed the promises of land and descendants that he had given to Abraham and Isaac (28:10-15). Jacob worshiped the Lord and named the place Bethel (“house of God”).\nAt Haran, Jacob began to serve his uncle Laban (Gen 29–31). Jacob loved Laban’s daughter Rachel and worked seven years to marry her, but Laban deceived him by substituting his older daughter Leah on Jacob’s wedding night. Jacob worked seven more years for Rachel and an additional six years to acquire flocks for himself (30:25-43; see also 31:38-42). Despite many hardships, he had thirteen children and became very prosperous.\nAfter twenty years, God told Jacob to return to Canaan (31:3). Fearing reprisals from Laban and his sons (31:1-2), Jacob organized his caravan and left while Laban was away (31:4-21). Laban gave chase, but God prevented him from harming Jacob (31:22-24, 29). Laban instead upbraided Jacob for leaving stealthily and for stealing his idols (31:25-30). Jacob let Laban search his tents, but the idols were not found (31:33-35), and Jacob became angry (31:36-42). Though their conflict remained unresolved, the two men made a peace covenant (31:43-54); the location formed a lasting boundary between Israel and Aram.\nJacob now faced Esau and God. When Esau came to meet him with four hundred men, Jacob sought God’s protection and sent gifts to pacify his estranged brother (32:3-21). Meanwhile, that night, in an event that symbolized his whole life, Jacob wrestled with a man who dislocated his hip and gave him the blessing he sought (32:22-32). God also changed his name to Israel (“God fights”).\nIn the morning Jacob met Esau and the two were reconciled (33:1-11); Esau was gracious and forgiving, and Jacob shared some of his blessing. Esau then returned to Seir while Jacob continued to Canaan. In Shechem, Jacob bought land and built an altar (33:18-20), then moved to Bethel and expelled all foreign idols from his household (35:1-8). God reaffirmed Jacob’s new name, Israel, and renewed his promises of land and descendants (35:9-15).\nJacob’s favoritism for Rachel extended to her son Joseph (37:1-3). Joseph's brothers became filled with jealousy and hatred toward Joseph—further fueled by Joseph's dreams (37:4-11)—and they sold him as a slave (37:12-28). For over twenty years Jacob believed Joseph was dead. Only after letting Benjamin go to Egypt in Judah’s care did Jacob learn that Joseph was alive and would be the source of famine relief for his family (43:1-14; 45:24-28). Jacob’s spirits revived, and he moved to Egypt and joyously reunited with his favorite son at Goshen (46:28-30), where he prospered for seventeen more years.\nWhen Jacob approached death at age 147, he arranged for the future of his family. He made Joseph swear to bury him in Canaan (47:29-31; 49:29-32). He gave Joseph’s sons his prime blessing (48:1-20) and put Ephraim, the younger son, first. He gave assurance that the family would return to Canaan (48:21-22), then blessed each of his sons and prophesied the future of their descendants (49:1-28). He died and was buried at the cave of Machpelah, accompanied by his sons and a large Egyptian procession (49:33–50:13). His death marked the end of the patriarchal age and the beginning of Israel’s growth as a nation in Egypt until they returned to live again in the Promised Land (see Exodus—Joshua).\nThe name “Jacob” became synonymous with the nation of Israel (see Num 23:7, 21; 24:5; Hos 12:2). God called the nation to serve him as their forefathers had done (Hos 12:3-14). He promised Israel the same love that he had shown toward Jacob (Mal 1:2). And he promised that a conquering ruler would come from Jacob’s descendants (Gen 49:8-12; Num 24:17-19).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 25:19-34; 27:1–35:29; 37:1-35; 42:1-4, 29-38; 43:1-13; 45:25–50:14; Exod 1:1-5; Num 23:7-10, 20-23; 24:5-9, 17-19; Deut 26:5; Josh 24:4, 32; Hos 12:2-14; Mal 1:2; John 4:5-6, 12; Acts 7:8-16; Rom 9:10-13; Heb 11:8-9, 20-21",

    "content": "Egypt\nEgypt was already a great and ancient civilization when Joseph rose to power (Gen 39–41) and Jacob’s family traveled there for food (chs 42–46; cp. 12:10-20). Its unique location and geography gave it security from invaders (with the harborless Mediterranean Sea to the north, the rugged Sinai peninsula to the east, and a great desert to the west) and made it an attractive refuge for foreigners during times of drought.\nEgypt has been called “the gift of the Nile,” and no other river has been so vital to the history of the nation through which it flows. To the Egyptians it was simply “the River.” The Nile is more than just the longest river in the world. Without its water, civilization would have been impossible in Egypt—the Nile is Egypt’s lifeblood, and the Egyptians worshiped it for the life and fertility that it provided. The river’s annual floods constantly brought new and fertile soil for crops, and its waters provided food from its abundance of fish and waterfowl as well as fresh water for drinking and cleaning. It also functioned as the main means of travel, trade, and communication. During times of drought, when the surrounding nations were in danger of famine, the Nile gave Egypt a reliable supply of fresh water. The Nile defined every aspect of life in Egypt and made Egypt what it was.\nEgypt figured significantly in biblical events. Abraham lived there in a time of famine (Gen 12:10-20). Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt and rose to a position equivalent to that of prime minister (Gen 37–41). Joseph’s family then came to reside in the eastern delta region of Goshen during another time of famine (Gen 42–50). Their descendants were later enslaved (Exod 1), and God’s rescue of his people in the exodus from Egypt would become the central defining story of the Jewish people (Exod 2–15).\nLater, during Israel’s monarchy, Egypt was continually involved in the struggle for international power (e.g., 1 Kgs 14:25-28). After the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem in 586 BC, a group of Jews moved to Egypt to escape Babylon’s influence (Jer 43:6-7).\nAt the opening of the New Testament, Egypt once again served as a refuge, this time for Joseph, Mary, and Jesus as they fled the assassination attempts of Herod the Great (Matt 2:13-23).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:10-20; 37:1–50:26; Exod 1:1–15:21; 1 Kgs 14:25-28; Isa 19:1-25; Jer 43; 46:7-8; Ezek 29:1-21; Amos 8:8; 9:5; Zech 10:11; Matt 2:13-23",

    "content": "Aaron\nMoses’ older brother, Aaron (see Exod 6:20; 7:7), played a crucial role in founding Israel and its institutions, particularly the priesthood. He first appears after Moses’ calling at the burning bush (Exod 3:1–4:17). Moses was reluctant to accept his divine commission, claiming that he was unfit to lead the Israelites out of Egypt because his words tended to “get tangled” (Exod 4:10). Despite God’s assurances, Moses continued to object until God appointed Aaron to be Moses’ mouthpiece. Thereafter, Aaron was often at Moses’ side, speaking to the Israelite leaders and demanding that Pharaoh let the Israelites leave Egypt (Exod 5:1-5).\nDuring the Israelites’ wilderness wanderings, God appointed Aaron and his sons to be set apart and dedicated as priests (Exod 28:1-5; 29:1-46; Lev 8:1-36). Thus, Aaron became Israel’s first high priest. Aaron’s role as high priest was especially prominent on the annual Day of Atonement, the only day when the high priest entered the Most Holy Place to purify it from the effects of Israel’s sins (Lev 16). Before the high priest could do so, however, he had to offer a sacrifice to atone for his own sins.\nAaron was an imperfect leader. While Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the law from God, Aaron helped the people make an idol (Exod 32). When Moses returned, Aaron gave poor excuses and blamed the people. This event resulted in the death of three thousand Israelites, as well as a plague.\nAaron and his sister, Miriam, once wrongly challenged Moses’ authority, resulting in a temporary state of leprosy for Miriam (Num 12). Later, when other Levites challenged Aaron’s authority, God affirmed Aaron’s role by making his staff bud with almond blossoms (Num 17). However, because Moses and Aaron challenged God’s authority (Num 20:1-13), they both died in the wilderness without entering the Promised Land (Num 20:22-29).\nJesus has become the Great High Priest, far surpassing Aaron’s priestly authority and effectiveness (see Heb 7–10).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 4:14-17, 27-31; 6:20-27; 7:1-2; 28:1-5; 32:1-25; Num 12:1-12; 20:1-13, 22-29; Acts 7:39-41",

Moses rescued Jethro’s seven daughters from the rough treatment of other shepherds at a well and helped them water their flocks. At home they told their father of this surprising encounter with “an Egyptian.” Jethro responded gratefully by inviting Moses for a meal, and Moses proceeded to settle there. At a later point, Jethro gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.\nWhile Moses was still living in Midian near his father-in-law, he encountered God at the burning bush (Exod 3:1-2). Before leaving for Egypt, Moses asked Jethro’s permission to go; he later sent his family to stay with Jethro during the Exodus.\nWhen Moses and the Israelites were in the wilderness, Jethro returned with Moses’ family. Jethro, having heard of Yahweh’s deliverance of his people from Egypt, acknowledged him as the God of all gods. He worshiped Yahweh with a burnt offering and sacrifices, thereby identifying himself with Israel (18:11). In response, Israel’s leaders joined him for “a sacrificial meal in God’s presence” (18:12).\nJethro saw that Moses was overwhelmed with caring for the vast numbers of Israelites, so he gave Moses good administrative advice about organizing the people more efficiently and about judging disputes among the people (18:13-23). Moses listened to this counsel and appointed able men to assist him as leaders and judges over the people (18:24-27).

    "content": "Pharaoh\n“Pharaoh” is an Egyptian word meaning “great house.” It refers to the royal palace and is also used as a title for the king of Egypt. During the time of Joseph, the Israelites were looked upon favorably by the pharaoh. Joseph had interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams, leading to his promotion as second-in-command in Egypt (Gen 41:1-44). Pharaoh gave Joseph’s family the best land in Egypt (Gen 45:16-20), and the Israelites multiplied and flourished in Egypt.\nTwo pharaohs appear in the book of Exodus, neither of whom had the same regard for the Hebrew people (see Exod 1:8-10). The first was king when Moses was born. Out of fear, he ordered the murder of all Hebrew baby boys. Moses not only escaped death, but was raised by Pharaoh’s daughter in the palace! This pharaoh died after Moses had fled from Egypt (Exod 2:23).\nA new pharaoh came to power, whom Moses and Aaron later confronted. This pharaoh was determined to prevent the Israelites from leaving Egypt; he remained stubborn even when confronted with God’s power. The Bible describes his hard-hearted unwillingness to change (see Exod 8:32; 9:12, 34-35; cp. Rom 1:18-32).\nAs king, the pharaoh personified the rule of the gods over Egypt, which gave him absolute authority. The plagues were God’s attacks on the false gods of Egypt (see Exod 12:12). The final plague—the death of the firstborn—was an attack on Pharaoh’s household. This climactic plague convinced Pharaoh to let Israel go, but after the Israelites left, Pharaoh again changed his mind. He chased them until he had cornered them at the Red Sea. God’s rescue of the defenseless Israelites and the destruction of the powerful Egyptians at the Red Sea is among the most dramatic rescues recorded in the Old Testament. The Lord revealed himself at the Red Sea as a warrior who fought for his people (15:3).\nNeither of the pharaohs in Exodus is mentioned by name, probably in keeping with Egyptian practice. However, if the Exodus took place in the 1400s BC, the Pharaoh of the Exodus might have been Thutmose III (around 1504–1450 BC). If the Exodus occurred in the 1200s BC (based on an alternative chronology), this pharaoh might have been Rameses II (around 1279–1213 BC).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 1:8-22; 2:14-15, 23; 5:1–15:21",

    "content": "Moses\nMoses was the founding leader of Israel as a nation. God used Moses at a critical juncture in the history of his people. He was the prophet who received the law and mediated God’s covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai (Exod 19:3-6). He was also the first known writer of Scripture.\nThe younger brother of Miriam and Aaron, Moses was born in Egypt under dangerous circumstances (Exod 1:15–2:2). The Egyptian pharaoh, fearing a rebellion, had decreed that all Hebrew boys be killed at birth. Moses’ mother, Jochebed, entrusted her infant son to God and set him afloat in the Nile in a reed basket. Pharaoh’s daughter found him and took him into the palace to raise as her own child (Exod 2:3-10).\nLittle is known about Moses’ upbringing. Jewish tradition holds that he received both administrative and military training in Pharaoh’s household. When he was about forty years old, he killed an Egyptian to rescue a Hebrew slave, and then he fled to Midian (2:11-15; cp. Acts 7:23-29). There he rescued some young women who were being harassed as they watered their flocks. Their father (Jethro) invited him home. Moses married one of the women, Zipporah, and began a family as he cared for his father-in-law’s flocks.\nAbout forty years later, God revealed himself to Moses in a burning bush and commissioned Moses to return to Egypt to rescue his people from slavery (Exod 3:1–4:17). Moses hesitated, fearful that the Israelites would not accept him as their leader. So God revealed to Moses his covenant name, Yahweh, and assigned Aaron as Moses’ spokesman.\nMoses and Aaron went to Egypt and confronted Pharaoh, who stubbornly resisted Moses' demand that he free the Israelite slaves. Moses then announced a series of plagues, which eventually convinced Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave. After they had left Egypt, Pharaoh changed his mind and pursued them to the edge of the Red Sea. God enabled the Israelites to cross safely to the other side by dividing the waters; the pursuing Egyptian army was destroyed when the waters closed over them.\nMoses led Israel to Mount Sinai, where he had encountered God at the burning bush. God again revealed himself to Moses on that mountain, giving him the law (including the Ten Commandments; Exod 20:1–23:19) and directions for building the Tabernacle. But when Moses came down from the mountain, he found that the people had already deserted the true God by worshiping a gold calf (Exod 32). Moses threw down and broke the two tablets of the law and rallied the Levites to execute some of the offenders. After praying for the people, he received a new copy of the law and led the people in building the Tabernacle.\nMoses led a grumbling, rebellious, and distrustful people through the wilderness. Even his own brother and sister challenged his leadership, using his marriage to a Cushite woman as an excuse (Num 12). Moses responded with great humility, and God affirmed that Moses was his spokesman and confidant.\nMoses was a great man, but not a perfect one. When the people stretched his patience by complaining about a lack of water, Moses failed to follow God’s instructions and struck a certain rock rather than speaking to it (Num 20:1-13). His actions failed to demonstrate God’s holiness, and by what he said, Moses implied that he had brought the water by his own power (Num 20:10; cp. Ps 106:32-33). As a result, God did not allow him to enter the Promised Land.\nBefore his death, Moses delivered a final sermon, known to us as the book of Deuteronomy. The first generation of Israelites, who had come out of Egypt, had died in the wilderness, so Moses was addressing a new generation. Moses renewed the covenant with this generation, reminded them of its terms, and encouraged them to obey it and serve the Lord alone.\nAfter giving this sermon and before Israel entered Canaan, Moses climbed Pisgah Peak on Mount Nebo, where he died. “There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face” (Deut 34:10). Only Jesus surpassed Moses as a mediator between God and human beings (Acts 3:17-26; Heb 3).\nMoses is mentioned in the New Testament more than any other Old Testament figure, and he appeared at Jesus’ transfiguration. The New Testament emphasizes his role as lawgiver and draws from Moses’ experiences to show patterns of life under the new covenant. Like Moses, Jesus was rescued as an infant from the evil designs of a human despot (Matt 2:13-18). Jesus’ proclamation of a new law in his Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5–7) parallels the giving of the law at Sinai and presents Jesus as the authoritative interpreter of God’s will. The letter to the Hebrews compares Christ with Moses, while Paul’s letter to the Galatians and the Gospel of John contrast the law of Moses with a believer’s new relationship with God (see John 1:17; Gal 3:1-5; Heb 3:5-6; 9:11–10:18).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 2:1-22; 3:1–19:25; 20:19-21; 24:1-18; 31:18; 32:1–34:35; 39:42-43; 40:16; Lev 8:1-36; 10:1-20; 24:10-23; Num 7:1-11, 89; 9:1-14; 10:29–14:45; 15:32-36; 16:1–17:13; 20:1-29; 21:4-9; 25:1-5; 27:1-23; 31:1–32:33; 33:1-2; Deut 1:1-5; 31:1–34:12; 1 Chr 23:13-17; Pss 77:20; 90:1-17; 103:7; 105:26-27; 106:32-33; Mark 9:2-13; Acts 7:17-44; 1 Cor 10:1-14; 2 Cor 3:7-18; Gal 3:19; Heb 3:1-19; 8:5; 9:19-22; 11:23-28; 12:18-29",

    "content": "Eleazar\nEleazar was the third son of Aaron, the first high priest (Exod 6:23). Eleazar’s two older brothers, Nadab and Abihu, offended God by offering incense in a different way than what God had commanded (Lev 10:1-7). Because of their disobedience, God killed them. Since Eleazar was the next oldest son, he was now in line to succeed his father as high priest. He performed priestly duties during his father’s lifetime, and he helped his father and Moses when some Levites rebelled because they wanted equal status with Aaron’s priestly family (Num 16:36-40).\nAaron died in the wilderness a short time before the Israelites entered the Promised Land. He was not allowed to enter because he and Moses had rebelled against God by striking the rock at Meribah (20:1-13). Before Aaron’s death, he, Moses, and Eleazar went up on Mount Hor, where Moses removed the priestly garments from Aaron and put them on his son (20:22-29).\nAfter this, Eleazar served as high priest for the rest of his life, which included the time of Canaan’s conquest. When it was time to divide the land among the tribes, Eleazar and Joshua cast the sacred lots to determine where each tribe would settle (Josh 14:1-5). When Eleazar died, he was succeeded by his son Phinehas, who had distinguished himself by his covenant faithfulness when Israel had turned to the gods of Moab (Num 25). Eleazar’s descendants included Zadok, the faithful priest who replaced Abiathar (1 Kgs 2:26-27, 35; see 1 Chr 6:3-8, 50-53), and Ezra, who was instrumental in reestablishing Judea after the Exile (see Ezra 7:1-5). In Ezekiel’s ideal temple, only the descendants of Eleazar through Zadok would be permitted to serve (Ezek 44:15).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 6:23-25; Lev 10:6-7; Num 3:1-4; 16:36-40; 20:22-26; 26:1-4; Josh 14:1",

    "content": "Balaam\nBalaam was a diviner—a person who read signs and omens to determine the future and performed rituals to change future events (see study note on Num 22:5-6; cp. Josh 13:22). He was a diviner for hire, so when Balak, king of Moab, wanted to hire him to curse Israel, he was eager to get started. Even when God told him not to go, he hoped God would change his mind because he was very interested in the money (2 Pet 2:15).\nFinally, God allowed Balaam to go, but only if Balaam agreed to say what God told him to say, and only to frustrate Balak’s purposes (Deut 23:4-5). On the road, Balaam’s donkey stopped and refused to move because the angel of the Lord was blocking the way. The donkey could see the angel, but Balaam was blind and foolish. Still, Balaam was smart enough not to curse the Israelites when God told him to bless them, and to Balak’s great frustration, that was all Balaam could do.\nRecently, an inscription was found that mentions Balaam son of Beor, a diviner who had visions at night (cp. Num 22:9-12, 20). The inscription was written on a plaster wall at Deir ‘Alla, eight miles east of the Jordan River, not far north of where the Hebrews were camped at the time of the Balaam incident. This nonbiblical text, dated 800–750 BC, identifies Balaam as a “seer of the gods” and reports that the gods, whose names in the inscription are similar to Shaddai (“Almighty”; cp. Num 24:4, 16), delivered a message to Balaam and announced judgment upon the world (cp. Num 24:15-25). The inscription provides rare extrabiblical evidence about a Bible character.\nWhile Balaam’s character and motives appear somewhat mixed in Numbers 22–24, chapter 25 describes how the men of Israel sinned by sleeping with Moabite women and worshiping their gods, which made God angry with his people. While Balaam is not mentioned here, Numbers 31:16 names him as the originator of this plot. After his visions were finished, Balaam apparently remained in Moab and kept working the angles until he found a way to damage Israel and get the money. The Israelites killed him a short time later (Num 31:8). Balaam became known as a magician with bad motives (see Deut 23:4-5; Josh 13:22), a false teacher who was only interested in pay (see Neh 13:2; 2 Pet 2:15; Jude 1:11), and someone who led Israel into idolatry and immorality (Num 31:16; see Rev 2:14).\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 22:1–25:18; 31:8, 16; Josh 13:22; 2 Pet 2:15-16; Jude 1:11; Rev 2:14",

    "content": "Moab and Ammon\nThe Moabites were descended from Moab, the son of Lot and his oldest daughter (Gen 19:36-38). They settled on the high plateau immediately east of the Dead Sea. Most of Moab is gently rolling tableland divided by ravines. Even at its peak, ancient Moab encompassed a relatively small territory, but its location on the King’s Highway was strategically important (see Num 21:21-22; Judg 11:15-18). Prior to the Israelites’ passage through the Transjordan, the Moabites were dominated by Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled at Heshbon (see Num 21:13, 26). After Israel defeated Sihon, King Balak of Moab feared that Israel might conquer his land, and Moab waged war against them (Num 22:1–25:3; Josh 24:9). From that time onward, Moab and Israel were often in conflict (Judg 3:12-30; 1 Sam 14:47; 2 Sam 8:2; 2 Kgs 3), but there were also periods of peace (Ruth 1:1-2) between them. A Moabite woman named Ruth displayed great kindness to her tragedy-plagued Israelite mother-in-law, Naomi, and she came to be part of the family line that produced King David and Jesus.\nThe Ammonites traced their ancestry to Ammon, son of the younger daughter of Lot (Gen 19:36-38). They settled in an area of the Transjordan northeast of the Dead Sea. When the Israelites arrived in the area after leaving Egypt, God instructed them not to try to occupy Ammonite territory, as it had already been given to the descendants of Lot (Deut 2:18-19, 37). The Ammonites helped the Moabites oppose Israel and were excluded from the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation (Deut 23:3-6; Neh 13:1-2; see Num 22:1–25:3). Thereafter the Ammonites were frequent enemies of Israel (Judg 10–11; 1 Sam 11; 14:47; 1 Chr 20:1-3; 2 Chr 20:1-24), though David seems to have allied with them for a time (2 Sam 17:27-29; 23:37).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 23:3-6",

    "content": "Joshua\nJoshua, son of Nun, was Moses’ assistant and successor as Israel’s leader. Joshua brought the young nation across the Jordan River into the Promised Land of Canaan, faithfully following God’s leadership.\nBefore Israel reached Mount Sinai, Joshua led Israel’s warriors when Amalek attacked Israel (Exod 17:8-13). Shortly thereafter, he was among the twelve men Moses sent to scout the Promised Land (Num 13:1-16). Against popular opinion, Joshua and Caleb urged Israel to occupy Canaan immediately (Num 13:22–14:9), and as a result, of the twelve spies, only they entered Canaan (Num 14:30, 36-38).\nGod directed Moses to designate Joshua as his successor (Num 27:15-23; Deut 34:9). After Moses died, Joshua led Israel across the Jordan River (Josh 1:1-18; 3:1–4:24) to the conquest of Jericho (6:1-27). When Israel suffered defeat at Ai, Joshua turned to the Lord and followed his instructions to purge Israel of sin (7:1-26); then Israel conquered Ai (8:1-29). Following God’s instructions to Moses (Deut 11:29-32; 27:1–28:68), Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal (Josh 8:30-32) and read the blessings and curses of the covenant (8:33-35). Joshua conducted campaigns against two coalitions of Canaanite kings, a southern and a northern coalition (10:1-43; 11:1-15). Joshua’s victories in these campaigns opened the hill country to settlement by the Israelites.\nAfter supervising the allotment of territories to the tribes of Israel, Joshua received his own portion in the land of Ephraim (19:49-50). He established the cities of refuge (20:1-9) and the Levitical cities (ch 21:1-45) and released the 2½ tribes that had settled east of the Jordan River to return home (22:1-9). As he grew old, Joshua charged Israel to remain faithful to God (23:1–24:28). His farewell message at Shechem summarized God’s dealings with Israel and concluded with the familiar challenge, “Choose today whom you will serve. . . . But as for me and my family, we will serve the Lord” (24:15). Joshua died at the age of 110 and was buried in Timnath-serah (Josh 24:29-30; Judg 2:8-9).\nJoshua demonstrated exceptional faithfulness throughout his life, except in dealing with the Gibeonites (Josh 9:1-27), when he neglected to consult the Lord regarding a decision. Israel served God faithfully under Joshua and the elders Joshua trained (Josh 24:31; Judg 2:7). Stephen mentions Joshua in his martyr’s sermon (Acts 7:45), and the writer of Hebrews uses Joshua’s conquest of Jericho as an illustration of faith (Heb 11:30). It is fitting that Joshua and Jesus are the same name in Hebrew: Joshua led Israel into physical salvation in Canaan; Jesus leads all who believe in him into eternal salvation.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 17:8-15; Num 13:1–14:38; 27:15-23; 34:17; Deut 34:9; Josh 1:1-18; 4:1–24:33; Judg 2:6-9; Heb 11:30",

    "content": "Rahab\nRahab, a prostitute and a woman of faith, remains enigmatic centuries after her brief appearance in Israel’s history. Because she placed her faith in Israel’s God and helped the two Israelite scouts who came to her house, her life was spared when Israel captured Jericho.\nBecause Rahab’s house stood on the wall of the city, Joshua’s scouts went there when they entered Jericho. Rahab might have been an innkeeper as well as a prostitute; other documents from the Old Testament era record women innkeepers who were also prostitutes. If Rahab’s house was in fact an inn, it would have been a reasonable destination; Joshua’s scouts could hope they would not attract unwanted attention.\nRahab’s arrangement with the scouts was a stirring declaration of faith in Yahweh, Israel’s God (Josh 2:8-21). As a Canaanite woman, Rahab would have practiced the fertility cult of Baal, god of the storm and life-giving rain, and of his consort Asherah, the mother earth goddess. Yet based on reports of Israel’s progress toward her land, Rahab recognized that Yahweh, the God of Israel, is “the supreme God of the heavens above and the earth below” (2:11).\nAfter Joshua’s conquest of Jericho, Rahab married Salmon of the tribe of Judah; she gave birth to a son, whom they named Boaz (Ruth 4:21; Matt 1:5). Thus, Rahab was the mother-in-law of Ruth, another foreign woman adopted into Israel. Rahab was also King David’s great-great-grandmother. She is listed with Moses, David, Samson, and Samuel as an example of faith demonstrated by good deeds (Heb 11:31; Jas 2:25). She is one of five women (including Mary) mentioned in Matthew’s genealogy of Jesus, the human family tree of God’s Son (Matt 1:5). Rahab bears especially poignant witness to the breathtaking scope of God’s grace.\nPassages for Further Study\nJosh 2:1-21; 6:17, 22-25; Matt 1:5; Heb 11:31; Jas 2:25",

    "content": "Caleb\nCaleb stands as an inspiring example of faith in God. He was the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite (Josh 14:6; Num 32:12). The Kenizzites lived in the Negev, the southern desert region of Canaan (see Gen 15:18-21). Jephunneh apparently married into the tribe of Judah a generation before Israel left Egypt.\nCaleb first appears as one of twelve spies Moses sent to scout out the land of Canaan. Upon returning, all twelve confirmed the land’s magnificence, but ten of the scouts focused on the land’s fearsome inhabitants (Num 13:31-33). Only Joshua and Caleb believed that God would enable Israel to conquer the Canaanites (Num 14:6-9), advising that the Israelites immediately take the land (Num 13:30). Although the people wanted to stone both Caleb and Joshua (Num 14:10), God protected them and punished the people (Num 14:11-38). God ultimately rewarded Caleb and Joshua for their faithfulness: Among all the adults who left Egypt, they were the only ones to enter the Promised Land.\nAfter many years in the wilderness, and after fighting many battles, Caleb received his personal inheritance in the land (Josh 14:6-15). Caleb’s faith did not diminish in the intervening forty-five years; his testimony reveals his character and rock-solid faith in God. Although Caleb was eighty-five years old, he was still strong and able to fight. Caleb acquired Hebron, which would become his land, by driving out the giant Anakites who had terrified the earlier scouts (Josh 15:13-14; see Num 13:28, 33). Caleb’s city of Hebron, about twenty miles south of Jerusalem (not far from Kenizzite territory), later became a Levitical city of refuge (Josh 21:13; 1 Chr 6:54-57).\nCaleb looked beyond serious obstacles to God’s unbreakable promise that Israel would occupy Canaan. With unabated vigor, he stood ready to conquer the territory Joshua assigned him. Caleb’s staunch confidence in the reliability of God’s promises earned him an honored place among the faithful. Even when outnumbered by enemies, Caleb trusted God, and God richly rewarded him.\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 13:1–14:38; 26:65; 32:12; 34:19; Deut 1:36; Josh 14:6-15; 15:13-19; Judg 1:11-15, 20; 1 Chr 4:15",

    "content": "The Philistines\nThe Philistines, situated on the southeast coastal plain of the Mediterranean, were part of a larger group of maritime immigrants from the Aegean area known by the Egyptians as the “Sea Peoples.” They settled on Palestine’s lower coastal plain around 1200 BC and established the five cities of Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gaza, and Gath.\nFar from being unsophisticated, the Philistines were politically capable and technologically advanced. They were also fierce warriors. Their advances in iron technology made them an almost invincible foe (see 1 Sam 13:19-22). They were constant adversaries of the Israelites in the days of the judges (approximately 1350–1050 BC) and the early united monarchy (approximately 1050–970 BC). Saul eventually died in battle against the Philistines (1 Sam 31:1-13). David, however, vanquished them before becoming king (1 Sam 18:20-30; 19:8; 23:1-5) and continued to gain victory over them during his reign (2 Sam 5:17-25; 8:1; 21:15-22). While the Philistines never completely disappeared while Israel was a nation (2 Kgs 18:8; 2 Chr 17:11; 21:16-17; 26:6-7; 28:18), David effectively ended this menacing threat.\nIn 1 Samuel, God used the Philistines to eliminate the sinful family of Eli (1 Sam 4:10-22). The Philistines were also God’s tool for building David’s military and political career (1 Sam 17:32-58; 18:20-30). They distracted Saul when he was about to capture David (1 Sam 23:26-28), provided David with refuge from Saul (1 Sam 21:10-15; 27:1-12), prevented David from having to fight his own people (1 Sam 29:1-11), and by killing Saul and his sons (1 Sam 31:1-13), opened the way for David to become king. In the end, however, the Philistines experienced God’s judgment (see Ezek 25:15-17; Amos 1:6-8).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 10:13-14; Judg 3:1-3; Judg 13:1–16:31; 1 Sam 5:1–6:18; 13:16–14:23; 21:10-15; 23:1-5, 26-28; 31:1-10; 2 Sam 5:17-25; 8:1; 21:15-22; 2 Kgs 18:8; 2 Chr 17:10-11; 21:16-17; 26:6-7; 28:18-19; Isa 2:6; Ezek 25:15-17; Amos 1:6-8; 9:7",

    "content": "Deborah\nDeborah the prophet was one of the early judges of Israel, a woman of integrity and devotion to the Lord. As a prophet, she received divine revelation; as a judge, she arbitrated legal disputes. She could aptly be characterized as “a mother for Israel” (see Judg 5:7).\nThe time period in which Deborah lived was one of increasing moral depravity, spiritual blindness, and political fragmentation. Israel was doing “evil in the Lord’s sight” (Judg 4:1), so God once again turned Israel over to an oppressor, Jabin of Canaan. And once again, Israel “cried out to the Lord for help” (4:3).\nThrough Deborah, God called Barak to fight against Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army. But Barak did not receive God’s call with enthusiasm and courage. Instead, he set a condition: Deborah must go with him. Deborah agreed, but with a cost: The glory for the victory would not go to Barak but to a woman. And so it happened: Barak defeated Sisera and his army, but the glory went to Jael, the woman who killed Sisera and fulfilled Deborah’s prophecy. Barak’s lack of courage and leadership contrasts with the courage and leadership of these two women. Deborah’s actions resulted in a forty-year period of peace for Israel (5:31).\nPassages for Further Study\nJudg 4:1–5:31",

    "content": "Gideon\nGideon, an Israelite judge, was the son of Joash, from the tribe of Manasseh. Gideon described his clan as the least powerful in Manasseh and himself as the least important in the clan. His story tells how God can take a weak person and use them for great purposes.\nAt the time, Israel was being oppressed by Midian and had cried out to God for relief (Judg 6:6). In response, God sent a prophet to chastise them for neglecting him and worshiping other gods. He also sent his angel to call Gideon to rescue Israel.\nGideon’s first appearance is not promising. He was threshing wheat in the bottom of a winepress because he did not want the Midianites to know what he was doing. When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon in the winepress, Gideon questioned why God had not rescued his people as at the Exodus. God said that Gideon was chosen to be Israel’s deliverer, and that God himself would be with him. Gideon was slow to believe, and he requested a sign. He brought an offering, and when the angel touched the sacrifice, fire came from the rock beneath it.\nThis sign gave Gideon enough faith to act locally. God told him to knock down his father’s altar to Baal, cut down the Asherah pole, and build an altar to the Lord instead. Gideon did what God had commanded, becoming a warrior for God against false gods.\nThen the Spirit of God came on Gideon, and he raised an army to fight the Midianites and their allies. Gideon was still cautious, and he asked God to give him another sign to confirm his calling. He put out a fleece on two separate nights and asked God to reveal his power by having the dew settle on the fleece and/or the ground in miraculous ways. God did so and Gideon was now prepared to follow God’s plan.\nGideon had great success as an army recruiter as 32,000 men responded to his call. Yet God directed him to pare down the numbers to 300 men. Gideon led these 300 men against an overwhelming force and defeated them.\nGideon rightly resisted the people’s call to be their ruler, but then he made an ephod from the earrings of the defeated soldiers, and the ephod became an idol (8:22-27). Gideon, weak in faith and dependent on visible signs, eventually turned away from worshiping the invisible God and worshiped idols. Israel enjoyed peace during his time, but his lack of faith bore bitter fruit after his death (8:33–9:57).\nPassages for Further Study\nJudg 6:1–8:35; 1 Sam 12:11; Isa 10:26; Heb 11:32",

    "content": "Samson\nSamson is a prime illustration of God’s using a person for good in spite of that person’s indifference and sin. Samson was a rescuer of Israel without even trying or caring. He did not seem to care about his people, his family, or his God. All he cared about was himself. Nonetheless, God, put him in situation after situation where he brought harm to the Philistines, whom God had allowed to oppress sinful Israel.\nThe first example of how God used Samson occurred after he told his shocked parents that he wanted to marry a Philistine girl. Israelites were commanded not to intermarry with the people of the land (Deut 7:1-4; Josh 23:12-13; cp. 2 Cor 6:14-18), but Samson persisted over his parents’ objections. As he was on his way to the wedding party, he scooped honey out of a dead lion he had earlier killed. Samson was born a Nazirite, and Nazirites were absolutely forbidden from touching a dead body (Num 6:1-21), but Samson didn’t care. He then made up a riddle about the lion (Judg 14:14) and bet thirty young Philistine men that they could not solve his riddle. The men pestered his wife into telling them the answer. As a result, Samson became so angry that he killed thirty Philistine men and took their clothing to pay off the bet. God used the self-serving hero to “begin to rescue Israel from the Philistines” (13:5).\nIn the final, climactic story of Samson’s life (16:4-31), Samson’s lover, Delilah, nagged Samson until he revealed the secret of his strength and thus betrayed his Nazirite vow. She cut his hair, and the Philistines were finally able to overpower him. They blinded him, tied him up securely, and loaded him with menial work. While in captivity, Samson’s hair began to grow again. One day, when the Philistines were celebrating and making fun of him, he asked to be led to the two central pillars of their pagan temple. He then prayed to God to give him the strength to kill the Philistines and take his own life. So he pulled the temple down on the heads of about 3,000 Philistines as well as himself. Even this act, however, was not done for his people or his God, but to “pay back the Philistines for the loss of [his] two eyes” (16:28). Even though it was all in God’s plan, the story of Samson makes the reader long for a better savior.\nPassages for Further Study\nJudg 13:1–16:31; Heb 11:32",

    "content": "Ruth\nThe story of Ruth tells of a kind and loyal woman and of the hidden providence of God, who makes all things work together for the good of those who love him (Rom 8:28). This story, part of the history that leads to the Messiah himself, starts with sadness but ends happily.\nRuth lived during the turbulent period of the judges. A foreigner from Moab, she married into an Israelite family from Bethlehem when that family was living in Moab. All the men of this Israelite family died in Moab, leaving behind three widows—Ruth, her mother-in-law Naomi, and her sister-in-law Orpah. When Naomi decided to return to her hometown of Bethlehem, Ruth cast her lot with her mother-in-law. Ruth’s declaration of love, loyalty, and faith in the Lord (Naomi’s God) has few equals (Ruth 1:16-17).\nAs Naomi had expected, the situation in Bethlehem was difficult for her and her daughter-in-law. Ruth, by her own initiative, undertook solving the problem of food for herself and Naomi through the hard and risky task of gleaning in the grain fields (2:2). She acted with modesty, grace, and courtesy, but also with determination, focus, and endurance.\nWith Naomi’s encouragement, Ruth then took the initiative in asking Boaz, the wealthy landowner who was supporting Ruth’s gleaning, to act as the family redeemer (3:1-9), which would include marriage. In doing this, Ruth was exercising great “family loyalty” (3:10); Ruth’s generous and diligent care for Naomi is a major theme throughout this little book. Boaz responded to Ruth’s proposal by calling her a “virtuous woman” (3:11), and she certainly embodied the characteristics of a virtuous and capable wife (cp. Prov 31:10-31, which uses the same Hebrew phrase and is placed immediately before Ruth in the Hebrew Bible).\nBoaz settled the legal matters and then married Ruth. The book ends by announcing the birth of a baby boy, Obed. With this ending we see an important purpose of the book of Ruth. Obed became the grandfather of King David. The New Testament includes Ruth as one of only five women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (Matt 1:5). The everyday faithfulness of Ruth had eternal significance as God worked out his purposes through her.\nPassages for Further Study\nRuth 1:4–4:13; Matt 1:5",

    "content": "Eli\nEli was Israel’s chief priest at the Tabernacle at Shiloh, Israel’s central shrine during the period of the judges. Eli apparently descended from Ithamar, Aaron’s youngest son (cp. 1 Kgs 2:27; 1 Chr 18:16; 24:3). Eli was sincere and devout, but he was weak in parenting his wicked sons, Hophni and Phinehas.\nWhen Eli encountered Hannah at the Tabernacle, he accused her of drunkenness as she fervently but silently asked God for a child. Upon realizing his mistake, Eli blessed Hannah, and God answered Hannah’s prayer by giving her Samuel.\nSamuel “grew in favor with the Lord and with the people” (1 Sam 2:26), but Eli’s sons “were scoundrels who had no respect for the Lord” (2:12). They stole from the offerings and seduced women who served at the Tabernacle. When Eli reproached them, they disregarded him. God sent a prophet to denounce Eli’s weakness and his sons’ wickedness and to announce that God would withdraw the priesthood from Eli’s family (2:27-36). This oracle was confirmed when God spoke to Samuel one night, telling him that he would soon punish Eli’s family (3:1-14). Shortly thereafter, Israel’s army was defeated in battle against the Philistines, the Ark of the Covenant was captured, and Eli’s sons were killed (4:1-11). When Eli, who was ninety-eight years old, heard the news, he fell over backward, broke his neck, and died (4:12-18). His daughter-in-law went into labor and died delivering Eli’s grandson, named Ichabod (“where is the glory?,” 4:19-22) because the glory had departed from Israel.\nEli’s priestly line survived, however, until David’s reign ended. Abiathar was Eli’s last descendant to serve as chief priest. Since he supported Adonijah’s attempt to usurp David’s throne, Solomon removed Abiathar from office and replaced him with Zadok (1 Kgs 2:27).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 1:9-18, 25-28; 1 Sam 2:11–4:22; 1 Kgs 2:27",

    "content": "Saul\nSaul was the first king of Israel. He was chosen by God and the people, but he failed tremendously because he lacked confidence in himself and in God. Saul was a very complex character who sometimes elicits our sympathy. He was also the source of his own problems, especially as he brought heartache and trouble into the lives of those close to him.\nSaul, the son of a wealthy landowner, became king unexpectedly and reluctantly. The people had requested a king to help them fight their battles, so they were happy with Saul, who was a head taller than anyone else (1 Sam 10:23). Their military problems were overwhelming, however, and Saul was not a confident military leader. Had it not been for the prophet Samuel and Saul’s son Jonathan, Saul’s reign might have been marked by complete disaster.\nSaul offended God by taking rash vows during wartime (14:16-46) and wrongly performing sacrifices before battle rather than waiting for Samuel (13:7b-14). He also failed to obey God’s instruction to destroy all the people and plunder of the Amalekites (15:1-35). So God determined to remove Saul from the kingship and sent Samuel to anoint David. Soon Saul was deeply suspicious of David, his son’s best friend and his own most loyal servant. The reluctant king became a despot, clinging to power at all costs. He spent much time and effort in pursuit of David, seeking to kill him.\nSaul was wounded in battle against the Philistines, then fell on his own sword. His death was a result of God’s judgment. Although David had spent considerable time fleeing from Saul, he honored the first king and his son Jonathan with a moving eulogy (2 Sam 1:17-27).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 9:1–11:15; 13:1–31:13; 2 Sam 1:1-27; 1 Chr 9:35–10:14",

Yet when God rejected Saul and chose David, Jonathan welcomed and supported David’s rise to power (1 Sam 18:1-4; 19:1-7).\nJonathan was a magnificent military leader. He led his father’s army to victory over the Philistine garrison at Geba (13:3-4). In another daring move, Jonathan and his armor bearer attacked a Philistine outpost by themselves; the ensuing confusion threw the Philistine army into disarray, allowing the main Israelite army to attack and win the day (14:1-23; see also David’s eulogy of Jonathan, 2 Sam 1:22). Saul had unwisely taken an oath that no one should eat until victory had been won. Jonathan did not know of the vow and ate some honey. When he learned of Saul’s vow, Jonathan criticized it harshly, and Saul would have executed Jonathan after the battle he had helped to win if the people had not intervened.\nWhen Jonathan and David met, they quickly became friends (1 Sam 18:1-4). Jonathan expressed his deep love for David by giving him his robe, tunic, sword, bow, and belt, which may have represented Jonathan’s belief that David should be the next ruler. When Saul tried to have David killed, Jonathan interceded for David and helped him slip away unharmed.\nJonathan remained with his father even after the Lord had made it clear that he had abandoned Saul. As a result, Jonathan died with Saul as they fought the Philistines (31:2; 1 Chr 10:2). Jonathan was a virtuous, daring, and selfless man who always spoke and acted with integrity. His love and courage helped David survive the demented attacks of King Saul.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 13:1–14:46; 18:1-4; 20:1-42; 23:16-18; 31:2; 2 Sam 1:1-27; 4:4",

She played a significant role in the transition from Saul’s reign to David’s.\nIn the ancient Near East, marriages of leading families were often politically motivated. Saul baited David into a dangerous situation by promising him his older daughter, Merab, if he would fight the Philistines. As a powerful warrior, David was an emerging leader in Saul’s kingdom. The king should have been happy to have such an ally, but he soon grew jealous of David’s accomplishments and suspicious of his ambitions. Saul hoped that David would die in the attempt, but the deal fell through. Later, Saul learned that his younger daughter, Michal, loved David (18:20), which gave the king another opportunity to bait David into fighting the Philistines. This time David agreed. When David returned victorious, Saul could not avoid giving David his daughter in marriage. This marriage alliance helped David when he was seeking to establish his credentials with the northern tribes (2 Sam 3:13-16).\nMichal loved David early in their relationship and even deceived her father to help David escape from a plot to kill him (1 Sam 19:11-17). After David left Saul’s court, Saul arranged another marriage for her (25:44), but David later broke up that marriage to get her back (2 Sam 3:13-16). Michal expressed contempt toward David when he danced joyfully before the Ark of the Covenant as it was being brought into Jerusalem (2 Sam 6:16-23). Because of her contempt for the king, Michal was unable to bear children.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 14:49; 18:17-30; 19:11-17; 2 Sam 3:13-16; 6:16-23",

    "content": "Abiathar\nAbiathar was high priest during David’s reign and into Solomon’s reign. He first encountered David before David became king. When David fled from Saul, he stopped at the city of Nob. Pretending that he was acting on Saul’s orders, David got food and supplies from the priests there. Saul discovered what had happened and was so angry that he killed all but one of the priests; only Abiathar escaped.\nAbiathar was among the first people from Saul’s administration to support David. His support was formidable; he represented the priesthood of Eli’s line and brought with him the holy ephod containing the Urim and Thummim (Exod 28:29-30), which allowed him to seek God’s will for David during crises (1 Sam 23:1-12; 30:7-8). After David became king, Abiathar served as priest along with Zadok, who was not a descendant of Eli (1 Chr 6:8; 18:16; 24:3). Both served David well; during Absalom’s rebellion, for example, they reported to David what was happening in the capital (2 Sam 15:27-37; 17:15-16).\nIn David’s old age, Abiathar wrongly supported Adonijah’s attempt to become king in his father’s place; Zadok remained loyal to David and supported Solomon (1 Kgs 1:5-8). As a result, once Solomon was on the throne, he removed Abiathar’s priestly authority and banished him to his estate in Anathoth (1 Kgs 2:26-27), a village about four miles northeast of Jerusalem. Zadok became the high priest, and that role passed to Zadok’s descendants rather than to Abiathar’s. This removal fulfilled “the prophecy the Lord had given at Shiloh concerning the descendants of Eli” (1 Kgs 2:27; see 1 Sam 2:27-36).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 22:20-23; 23:6, 9; 30:7; 2 Sam 15:27-37; 17:15; 1 Kgs 1:1–2:35; 1 Chr 15:11",

They were nomadic herdsmen; their territory in the Negev ranged from south of Beersheba to the southeast as far as Elath and Ezion-geber. They undoubtedly raided westward into the coastal plain, eastward into the Arabah wastelands, and possibly into Arabia.\nThe Amalekites were staunch enemies of Israel. Israel’s first encounter with the warriors of Amalek came at Rephidim near Sinai when they attacked Israel (Exod 17:8-16). In this encounter, the Amalekites were defeated by Joshua and the Israelite army. The Amalekites later rebuffed Israel’s disobedient attempt to enter the Promised Land (Num 14:39-45). As a result of their enmity, Moses instructed Israel to destroy them (Deut 25:17-19), but the Amalekites continued to inhabit the Negev (see Judg 3:12-14; 6:33; 1 Sam 14:47-48; 15:1-35). Those who survived remained Israel’s enemies (27:8; 30:1-20; 2 Sam 8:11-12; Ps 83:1-8). This remnant was finally destroyed during the reign of Hezekiah (1 Chr 4:42-43).

    "content": "Samuel\nSamuel lived at the end of the period of the judges and ushered in the period of kingship. He was Israel’s last judge (1 Sam 7:6, 15-17) and was essentially considered Israel’s first prophet (1 Sam 3:20; Acts 3:24; 13:20). He functioned as a priest (see 1 Sam 2:18) and was a great man of faith (Heb 11:32).\nSamuel was born in response to his mother Hannah’s prayers. Samuel’s parents traveled annually from Ramah to the sanctuary at Shiloh (1 Sam 1:3). While at the sanctuary, Hannah, who was infertile, prayed for a son and promised to dedicate him to God for full-time service (1 Sam 1:9-11). God answered the prayer, and Samuel was born (1 Sam 1:19-20). When Samuel was weaned, Hannah took him to serve in the sanctuary with Eli, the high priest (1 Sam 1:24-28; 2:11).\nEli’s sons were wicked, but Samuel served the Lord, and soon it became clear that God spoke more intimately with Samuel than with Eli. God spoke to Samuel to warn Eli of the coming disaster upon his family (1 Sam 3:1-18). This prophecy was fulfilled when the Philistines defeated Israel, killed Eli’s sons, and took the Ark of the Covenant (1 Sam 4:1-22). Later, under Samuel’s leadership, the people repented of their sin of idolatry and succeeded in winning an important battle against the Philistines (1 Sam 7:3-17).\nBut as Samuel grew older, it became obvious that he suffered from the same weakness as Eli before him. Samuel’s sons were evil (1 Sam 8:1-3), and the people did not want them to assume leadership over the nation. Instead, the people requested that Samuel appoint for them a king who could lead them in battle against their enemies (1 Sam 8:4-5). Samuel then anointed Saul as the first king of Israel (1 Sam 9:1–10:24).\nThe transition from the era of the judges to kingship was turbulent. As priest, Samuel prayed for the people; as prophet, he reproved Saul for impatience and disobedience (1 Sam 13:5-14; 15:12-35). When God rejected Saul as king, Samuel anointed David as God’s chosen one (1 Sam 16:1-13) and protected David from Saul (19:18-24).\nThrough prayer and perseverance, Samuel was a faithful leader (Jer 15:1; Heb 11:32) who cherished his people’s well-being and courageously rebuked kings and elders. He led Israel from tribal disunity to national solidarity and established the monarchy. He presumably wrote The Record of Samuel the Seer (1 Chr 29:29) and defined ideal kingship (1 Sam 10:25). When he died, he was mourned by all Israel. He was buried in Ramah, his hometown (25:1).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 1:19–2:11; 3:1–4:1; 7:3–16:13; 19:18-24; 25:1; 28:1-25; Ps 99:6; Jer 15:1; Acts 3:24; 13:20; Heb 11:32",

    "content": "David\nDavid is one of the monumental figures of biblical history. His reign was a high point in God’s plan for Israel, and it had great and lasting significance.\nDavid was born in Bethlehem as Jesse’s youngest son; his lineage is traced back to Judah (Ruth 4:18-22; 1 Chr 2:3-15; Matt 1:3-6; Luke 3:31-33). At the time of his birth, Jerusalem was occupied by the Jebusites, and large parts of the Promised Land were still occupied by foreign people, most notably the Philistines. God would use David to complete the conquest of the land.\nAs a youth, David was a simple shepherd, watching his father’s sheep (1 Sam 16:11; 17:14-15). His life took an unexpected turn when the prophet Samuel came to Jesse and anointed David as the next king of Israel. However, David’s kingship was not initiated by a coup or an assassination. In fact, David became a faithful servant to King Saul. David first entered Saul’s service as a musician, playing songs that soothed Saul’s tormented soul (16:14-23). This service anticipated David’s role as the composer of many of the psalms. The youthful David also helped Saul by famously defeating the Philistine champion Goliath in individual combat (17:32-51). This victory anticipated David’s role as a victorious military leader.\nAlthough David was loyal, Saul grew deeply suspicious of him, and David had to flee. He was able to escape with help from Saul’s own children, Jonathan and Michal. David led a virtual kingdom in exile. He had a standing army of six hundred men. The prophet Gad and the priest Abiathar were also with him, providing direction and guidance from the Lord.\nGod’s long-suffering patience finally ran out with Saul, and Saul died on the battlefield. Yet it was still not easy for David to establish his rule over all Israel. The tribe of Judah immediately proclaimed him its king, but at first the northern tribes chose Ishbosheth, a son of Saul, to be their leader. Ishbosheth was not a powerful or good leader; he only stayed in power because of the protection of his father’s military leader, Abner. However, Ishbosheth foolishly insulted Abner, so the general helped turn the kingdom over to David.\nAs king over a united Israel, David proceeded to solidify the kingdom. He and his men captured Jerusalem from the Jebusites and made this central city his capital. He also expelled the remaining Philistines from the land. He then brought the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem. David wanted to build a permanent temple to God in Jerusalem to replace the Tabernacle. God denied this wish, but he showed his love for David by entering into a covenant with him that established his descendants as a dynasty (2 Sam 7).\nDavid’s life soon took a turn for the worse, however (see 2 Sam 11–12). At a time when he probably should have been on the battlefield with his army, he was lounging around on the palace roof. He saw a beautiful woman named Bathsheba taking a bath. He wanted her, so, like a Near Eastern despot, he took her. She became pregnant, and his attempt to cover up his adultery failed. In a desperate attempt to keep things secret, he had her husband, Uriah, killed. But not even a great king like David can keep secrets from God, and God sent his prophet Nathan to confront David. David repented (see Pss 32, 51), but the consequences of his actions plagued his family and the rest of his reign.\nFrom that point on, David’s family fell apart. David’s son Amnon raped his half sister Tamar (2 Sam 13:1-14). Her brother Absalom then murdered Amnon (2 Sam 13:20-29). Absalom later created a civil war as he tried to steal the throne from his father (2 Sam 15–18). Another son, Adonijah, tried to take the throne from David by having himself proclaimed king while his father was still alive (1 Kgs 1:5-10). But David was able to muster enough strength to ensure that Solomon would succeed him (1 Kgs 1:28-40). David died, Solomon was proclaimed king, and David’s long dynasty began (as promised in 2 Sam 7).\nDavid’s successors seldom measured up. Only rarely did his descendants lead the nation to worship God faithfully; the united monarchy did not even outlive Solomon. In the centuries that followed, the descendants of David ruled only Judah in the south. Eventually, the kingdom of Judah was destroyed. Never again did a descendant of David reign as king in Israel.\nWhat, then, of the promise to David that “your throne will be secure forever” (2 Sam 7:16)? The New Testament points to Jesus. He was the descendant of David, and God proclaimed him the Christ, or Messiah—the anointed king (see Matt 1:1; 9:27; 12:23; Mark 10:47-48; 11:10; 12:35-37; Luke 18:38-39; 20:41-44; John 7:42; Rev 5:5; 22:16). The life and rule of David foreshadows the messianic reign of Jesus Christ, which will last forever (see Luke 1:32-33; Rev 11:15).\nPassages for Further Study\nRuth 4:13-22; 1 Sam 16:1–17:58; 18:1–27:12; 29:1–30:31; 2 Sam 1:1–24:25; 1 Kgs 1:1–2:12; 1 Chr 11:1–29:30; Pss 1–32, 34–41, 51–71, 86, 91–110, 122, 124, 131, 133, 138–145; Matt 1:1; 9:27; 22:41-46; Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44; John 7:40-44; Acts 2:22-37; 13:20-43; Rom 1:3; Rev 22:16",

    "content": "Abner\nAbner son of Ner was King Saul’s cousin as well as his general (1 Sam 14:49-52). Saul’s armies won important battles against the Philistines under Abner’s command (1 Sam 17:1-58), and Abner ate at the king’s table with David and Jonathan (1 Sam 20:24-25). Yet Jonathan and David both outshone Abner in Saul’s army.\nDavid shamed Abner on one occasion (1 Sam 26:1-25). When Saul was in pursuit of David so as to kill him, he and his troops were camped in a circle with Saul sleeping at the center and Abner beside him. Abishai and David sneaked into the camp and could have killed Saul. They took some items from beside Saul’s head; then, after retreating, David shouted to waken Saul and Abner and berated Abner for his carelessness.\nAfter Saul and Jonathan died, Abner promoted the interests of Saul’s son Ishbosheth (2 Sam 2:8-12) when the tribe of Judah made David king. During this time, Abner was the real power in the north. When Ishbosheth accused Abner of sleeping with one of Saul’s concubines, Abner turned the northern kingdom over to David. Ishbosheth was later murdered (4:1-12).\nDuring the battle between Ishbosheth and David, Abner was forced in self-defense to kill Joab’s brother Asahel, whom he did not want to kill and had warned to turn back (2:18-32). Abner was then murdered by Joab in calculated revenge (3:22-30), an evil act that David could not prevent (see 3:38-39). David honored Abner with a eulogy, public mourning, and a state funeral (3:31-37). Later, David remembered what had happened and made certain that Joab did not go unpunished for the murder (1 Kgs 2:5-6).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 14:49-52; 17:55-58; 26:5-16; 2 Sam 2:8-29; 3:6-39; 1 Kgs 2:5, 32",

    "content": "Bathsheba\nBathsheba, wife of Uriah, was the daughter of Eliam (2 Sam 11:3; cp. 1 Chr 3:5) and the granddaughter of Ahithophel, the king’s adviser (2 Sam 15:12; 23:34). Her husband, Uriah, was a Hittite mercenary in King David’s service and was one of David’s mighty men (23:39).\nOne spring, David stayed home in Jerusalem while the army went to the battlefield (11:1). Resting at midday, David strolled on his roof overlooking the city and saw the beautiful Bathsheba taking a bath. He arranged for her to be brought to his private chambers. Then he had sexual relations with her, and she became pregnant (11:2-4).\nNot wanting this scandal to become public, David arranged a cover-up: He told Joab, the general, to have Uriah bring back a report from the battle lines. David hoped that Uriah would return home and sleep with Bathsheba, thus legitimizing her pregnancy. But Uriah considered himself still on active duty, so he slept at the palace gate instead (11:5-13). When David asked him about this, he replied that he could not sleep with his wife while the Ark and the armies of Israel were on the battlefield. This answer put David in a very bad light: Uriah, who was not even an Israelite, was standing ready to return to battle by avoiding intercourse with his wife (see Lev 15:16-18), while David was staying at home and trying to cover up adultery! Then David sent Uriah back and ordered Joab to ensure that he was killed in battle (2 Sam 11:14-25). Uriah’s death did not keep David’s sin a secret, however. The Lord sent the prophet Nathan to confront David, and David confessed his sin and repented (12:1-14; see Ps 51).\nBathsheba’s baby became sick and died, as Nathan had predicted. After Bathsheba’s period of mourning, David brought her to the palace as his wife. David and Bathsheba had other children (Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon; 2 Sam 12:15-25; 1 Chr 3:5). The rest of David’s life is filled with intrigue among the different factions of his wives and children, culminating in David’s old age when Bathsheba sought to ensure the kingship for her son Solomon (1 Kgs 1:1-53).\nIn Matthew’s genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, both Solomon and Bathsheba appear (Matt 1:6); she is described there as “the widow of Uriah,” a reminder of the sin that brought her into David’s family and of God’s gracious favor toward her descendants.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 11:1–12:25; 1 Kgs 1:5–2:25; Ps 51:1-19",

    "content": "Zadok\nZadok was an important transitional figure in the history of Israel’s priesthood. Since he seemingly appears out of nowhere in the narrative of 2 Samuel (8:17), some scholars suggest that he was not really born into a priestly family. However, there is no reason to doubt the biblical record that he was Aaron’s descendant (1 Chr 6:1-15, 50-53). Zadok’s family line is traced back to Eleazar, Aaron’s son (1 Chr 6:4-8; 24:3; Ezra 7:2-5). Zadok served alongside Abiathar, a descendant of Eli. Zadok and Abiathar were priests of Israel under King David (2 Sam 8:17; 20:25).\nWhen Absalom revolted against King David, both Zadok and Abiathar showed their loyalty to David by taking the Ark to him, fully prepared to share in his exile (15:24-29). Instead, David sent them to Jerusalem as his spies.\nLater, when David’s son Adonijah tried to seize the aged David’s throne with the support of Joab and Abiathar, Zadok wisely refrained from supporting him (1 Kgs 1:5-10). Abiathar was banished (1 Kgs 2:26-27), fulfilling the prophecy that Eli’s family would be removed from the priesthood (1 Sam 2:27-36). In this same prophecy, God said, “I will raise up a faithful priest who will serve me and do what I desire. I will establish his family, and they will be priests to my anointed kings forever” (1 Sam 2:35).\nThe loyal Zadok fulfilled this prophecy and became the sole high priest under Solomon (1 Kgs 2:35). Zadok’s descendants served as Israel’s priests throughout the monarchy and beyond. Azariah, chief priest during Hezekiah’s reign, was of Zadok’s line (2 Chr 31:10). During the Exile, Ezekiel’s eschatological vision of the new Temple refers to Zadok’s priestly line (Ezek 40:46; 43:19; 44:15; 48:11). When the Jews later came under Seleucid domination in the early 100s BC, the high priesthood, by then regarded as a political appointment, was taken away from Zadok’s descendants. As a result of Ezekiel’s prophecies, Jewish groups such as those responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls continued to await the restoration of Zadok’s line to the high priesthood. The New Testament teaches that the office of the high priest now rests on Jesus Christ (Heb 9:11; 10:12-25).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 8:17; 15:23-37; 1 Kgs 1:5-53; 2:35; 1 Chr 6:1-15, 50-53; Ezra 7:2; Ezek 40:46; 43:19; 44:15; 48:11",

He was David’s nephew, a son of David’s sister Zeruiah and the brother of Joab and Asahel (1 Chr 2:13-16).\nAbishai was completely devoted to David and quick to suggest violence against David’s enemies. When God allowed David and Abishai to penetrate Saul’s war camp while the troops were sleeping, Abishai wanted to assassinate Saul, but David restrained him. Later, when the revolt of Absalom required that David leave Jerusalem, the king was cursed by Shimei, a member of Saul’s family, and Abishai wanted to execute Shimei (2 Sam 16:5-9). David twice rejected that proposal (2 Sam 16:10-13; 19:18-23). The vengeful spirit of Abishai and his brothers also came out in an earlier conflict: After Saul’s general, Abner, killed Abishai’s brother Asahel in self-defense, Joab and Abishai took revenge by killing Abner (3:22-30).\nAbishai was brave and very capable. He once killed three hundred soldiers in a single battle. For this, he was made leader of the Thirty, a group of especially skillful warriors surpassed only by the Three (1 Chr 11:20-21). Abishai also won a major victory over the Edomites (1 Chr 18:12-13). In a battle with the Philistines, Abishai saved David’s life by killing the giant Ishbi-benob (2 Sam 21:15-17). Abishai also led the army, and when it divided for strategic purposes, Abishai led one group while his brother Joab led the other (10:1-19; 18:1-18). Their military efforts were usually very successful.\nThough Joab’s actions eventually led to his death, we nowhere read about the same fate befalling Abishai, who, like Joab, was a violently impulsive military leader.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 26:6-12; 2 Sam 2:18; 3:30, 39; 10:10-14; 16:9-12; 18:1-8; 19:21-23; 20:6-10; 21:17; 23:18-19; 1 Chr 2:16; 11:20-21; 18:12-13; 19:11-15",

    "content": "Joab\nJoab was David’s nephew, the son of David’s sister Zeruiah (1 Chr 2:13-16); his brothers were Abishai and Asahel. Joab became commander of David’s armies because of his bravery and military skill (2 Sam 2:18; 8:16; 11:1; 1 Chr 18:15). As the first to attack the Jebusite city of Jerusalem, he was awarded the commander’s position (1 Chr 11:4-9). Joab also suppressed a rebellion among the Arameans and Ammonites (2 Sam 10:1-19; 1 Chr 19:8-15) and won many key battles for David against the northern army of Israel under Abner’s impressive command (2 Sam 2:12-32).\nJoab often acted to promote what he perceived were David’s interests. For example, he colluded with David in the death of Uriah the Hittite to cover up the king’s adultery with Bathsheba (11:1-27). He persuaded David to allow Absalom’s return to court (14:1-33), and he tried to talk David out of taking a census that provoked God’s anger (24:1-9; 1 Chr 21:1-6).\nThough he was very loyal to David, Joab sometimes acted in his own interest, and sometimes he disregarded the king’s orders. When Abner killed Joab’s brother Asahel (2 Sam 2:23), Joab killed Abner in revenge (3:26-30), despite Abner’s new loyalty to David (3:12-19). Later, Joab killed his own cousin Amasa (20:8-10), who commanded Absalom’s army (17:25), after David had appointed Amasa commander in Joab’s place (19:13; 20:4). Joab also killed Absalom against David’s direct order (18:5, 10-17). He then rebuked David for grieving Absalom’s death rather than congratulating the army (19:5-7). Joab was ruthless, and he regained the most powerful position in David’s army (20:23; 24:2; 1 Kgs 1:19).\nJoab sealed his fate by supporting Adonijah’s bid for David’s throne (1 Kgs 1:5-7). David’s deathbed instructions to Solomon included having Joab killed because of his murders of Abner and Amasa. When Solomon became king, he sent Benaiah to kill Joab even as Joab clung to the horns of the altar (1 Kgs 2:28-34). Joab met the same fate that he dealt to others throughout his life, and his executioner replaced him as commander of Israel’s army (1 Kgs 2:35).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 2:13-32; 3:22-39; 8:16; 10:7-14; 11:1-25; 12:26-28; 14:1-33; 17:25; 18:2–19:13; 20:7-23; 24:2-9; 1 Kgs 1:7, 19; 2:28-35; 11:15-16; 1 Chr 2:16; 11:6-8; 18:15; 19:8-15; 20:1; 21:2-6; 26:28; 27:24, 34; Ps 60:1-12",

    "content": "Absalom\nAbsalom, son of David, was a handsome prince (2 Sam 14:25-26). When his sister Tamar was raped by their half brother Amnon and then discarded, Absalom took her in (13:1-20). He might have expected David to punish Amnon, but David said nothing (13:21). For two years of suppressed rage and growing hatred (13:22), Absalom plotted revenge. Then he murdered Amnon and fled to his grandfather, King Talmai of Geshur (13:23-39).\nAfter three years, Joab convinced David to bring Absalom back, but David neither punished him nor was reconciled to him. Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years with privilege and unresolved alienation. Then he insisted on seeing the king. The two met and made at least a show of reconciliation (14:28-33). But for Absalom, the meeting might have been a maneuver toward the throne. Afterward, he put on a public-relations campaign to undermine the people’s confidence in David (15:1-6). Eventually, Absalom’s underhanded tactics bore the fruit he had hoped for: He launched a coup and gathered supporters in Hebron from all over Israel. By the time news of Absalom’s conspiracy reached David, the king was unable to do anything but flee Jerusalem (15:13-37; see Ps 3).\nWhen Absalom arrived in Jerusalem, David’s wisest adviser, Ahithophel, joined Absalom’s side and advised him to attack quickly while David was weak. But Hushai, David’s secret agent, advised him to gather more troops and attack with overwhelming force. This advice appealed to Absalom’s ego, but it was fatally wrong—as both advisers knew—to give such experienced warriors as David and his mighty men time to gather their strength, develop reconnaissance, and devise a strategy. By the time Absalom led his forces across the Jordan River to do battle in the forest of Ephraim, David and his loyal forces were well rested and under the supremely capable leadership of Joab, Abishai, and Ittai from Gath. David’s men outmaneuvered Absalom’s superior forces and routed them. Absalom himself fled on a mule, but his long hair got caught in the branches of a tree. Joab and his men came upon Absalom dangling helplessly and killed him, despite David’s command that they show him mercy (18:1-18).\nAbsalom’s death stunned David; his grief nearly alienated those who had risked their lives to end Absalom’s treasonous uprising against his kingdom (18:33–19:8). For Absalom’s part, he had good reasons to be unsatisfied with David’s rule. But rather than following his father’s example of trusting in the Lord and honoring the anointed king (1 Sam 24:5-11; 26:5-24), Absalom instigated a rebellion that resulted in his own death.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 3:3; 2 Sam 13:1–19:10; 1 Kgs 2:7; 15:2, 10; 1 Chr 3:2; Ps 3:1",

    "content": "Solomon\nSolomon was the third king of Israel, the second son of David and Bathsheba (2 Sam 12:13-25); he reigned forty years (971–931 BC). Solomon began his reign with promising confidence in God but ended his life as an idol-worshiper who destroyed his kingdom.\nAs King David neared death, his son Adonijah made an attempt on the throne, supported by the priest Abiathar and the general Joab (1 Kgs 1:1-53). The kingdom had been promised to Solomon, however (1 Kgs 1:17; see 2 Sam 12:24-25; 1 Chr 28:4-7), so Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan informed David of Adonijah’s intentions. David immediately arranged Solomon’s coronation. Then David advised Solomon to follow God faithfully (1 Kgs 2:1-9).\nSolomon loved God and sought his help. God asked him to choose a gift, and since he chose wisdom rather than long life, riches, or fame, God gave him all of these. Solomon governed wisely (1 Kgs 3:16-28), received worldwide respect (1 Kgs 4:20-34), and wrote the Song of Songs, along with most of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. Rabbis said that these books came from three stages of his life: “When a man is young he composes songs; when he grows older he makes sententious remarks; and when he becomes an old man he speaks of the vanity of things” (Midrash Rabbah). He also built the Temple in Jerusalem and his own palace, developed trade, and increased the wealth and security of Israel. His reputation for wisdom and wealth was very great, and the queen of Sheba traveled to Jerusalem to see him for herself (1 Kgs 10:1-29).\nUnfortunately, Solomon made many foreign alliances and married many foreign women, beginning with the daughter of Egypt’s pharaoh (1 Kgs 3:1). Solomon's foreign wives turned his heart away from God and toward idols. Later in life, the wise Solomon became extremely foolish under his wives’ influence; he worshiped false gods and oppressed his people. So God used Jeroboam to remove a large part of his kingdom.\nNonetheless, the New Testament remembers Solomon’s wisdom and glory as the standard against which others are measured. Jesus is the incarnation of God’s wisdom, which far surpassed that of Solomon (Matt 12:42; Luke 11:31).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 12:24-25; 1 Kgs 1:1–11:43; 2 Chr 1:1–9:31; Pss 72:1-20; 127:1-5; Prov 1:1; Matt 6:28-30; 12:42; Luke 11:31; 12:27",

    "content": "Jeroboam I\nJeroboam I, son of Nebat from the tribe of Ephraim, was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel (931–910 BC). He led the northern ten tribes into the sins that brought about the destruction of the northern kingdom.\nJeroboam began his political career by supervising Solomon’s labor forces in the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh (1 Kgs 11:26-28). Because Solomon had drifted away from the Lord, God determined to remove the ten northern tribes from the rule of David’s descendants. The prophet Ahijah told Jeroboam that the Lord had chosen him to lead those tribes and to give him a lasting dynasty if he was faithful (11:29-39). Solomon apparently caught wind of what had happened and tried to kill Jeroboam, who sought refuge in Egypt (11:40; cp. Saul and David, 1 Sam 18:5–20:42).\nWhen Solomon died, his son Rehoboam was immediately proclaimed king in Judah, but the northern tribes had to affirm his kingship separately. Seizing the opportunity, Jeroboam took the northern leaders to Rehoboam to seek relief from the harsh labor Solomon had forced on them (1 Kgs 12:1-4). Rehoboam foolishly spurned their request (12:5-14), so the north rebelled and appointed Jeroboam as its king (12:20). Thus the kingdom was divided, as God had promised.\nJeroboam did not remain committed to God, however. He worried that if his people went to the Temple in Jerusalem to worship, they would support the southern kingdom. He had no confidence in God to secure his reign, so he carried out his own plan to secure his people’s spiritual allegiance. He built two gold calf shrines, at the north and south of his kingdom (12:26-33). God was displeased with these shrines and sent a prophet to condemn Jeroboam. Though Jeroboam initially responded to the prophet’s display of divine power, the calf shrines remained intact throughout the northern kingdom’s history (931–722 BC). Jeroboam’s false religion was a key reason for the destruction of the northern kingdom in 722 BC (14:14-16; 2 Kgs 17:5-23).\nBecause of Jeroboam’s sins, God did not give him a dynasty (1 Kgs 13:33-34). Though Jeroboam’s son Nadab inherited the throne when his father died, he was assassinated—along with the rest of Jeroboam’s descendants—two years later by a usurper named Baasha (14:20; 15:25-31).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 11:26–14:20; 15:6-7, 25-28; 2 Chr 10:1–13:22",

    "content": "Rehoboam\nRehoboam, the son of Solomon and an Ammonite woman (1 Kgs 14:21), was forty-one when he became king; he reigned for seventeen years (931–913 BC). He is remembered for instigating the split of Solomon’s kingdom and for being the first king of Judah, the southern kingdom.\nWhen Solomon died (931 BC), Judah immediately proclaimed Rehoboam king. The ten northern tribes were hesitant to support him, demanding relief from Solomon’s harsh policies (see 12:4; 2 Chr 10:4). The king’s mature advisers urged him to agree to their requests, but he rejected their advice and foolishly listened to younger advisers, who advised him to be even tougher than his father. The northern tribes rebelled and proclaimed Jeroboam, Solomon’s former labor official, as their king. Rehoboam went to war, seeking control against the north, but God sent the prophet Shemaiah to tell him this was useless since the split was God’s judgment (2 Chr 11:1-4). So Rehoboam returned to Judah and fortified his boundaries (2 Chr 11:5-12).\nWhen Jeroboam established a new apostate religion in the northern kingdom, priests and Levites streamed to the south, where they strengthened the spiritual fiber of the realm and helped to maintain Judah’s stability (2 Chr 11:13-17). In the end, however, Rehoboam also turned to idol worship. The people of Judah built high places and pagan sanctuaries throughout the land and adopted corrupt religious practices from the heathen nations around them (1 Kgs 14:22-24). God stopped supporting Rehoboam, so he was vulnerable when King Shishak of Egypt attacked him and removed many precious items from the Temple (926/925 BC; 1 Kgs 14:25-26; 2 Chr 12:1-5). Rehoboam then replaced Solomon’s gold shields with bronze ones (1 Kgs 14:27), an act that represented the loss of Judah’s glory because of false worship.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 12:1-24; 14:21-31; 2 Chr 9:31–12:16",

    "content": "Ahab\nAhab, Israel’s eighth king, inherited the northern kingdom from his powerful father, Omri (1 Kgs 16:27-28), and reigned in Israel from 874 to 853 BC. Ahab married Jezebel, daughter of King Ethbaal of Sidon. Under her influence, Ahab began worshiping Baal instead of the Lord (16:29-33).\nAhab had several military successes. He achieved victories over the Arameans (20:1-34), and in 853 BC he led a coalition of kings against the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III and defeated him at the battle of Qarqar. However, the Old Testament reports little positive news about Ahab, who was a traitor to God. God raised up the prophet Elijah to confront Ahab, Jezebel, and their prophets and to reassert the supremacy of the true God (17:1; 18:1-46).\nAhab not only betrayed the Lord; he also exploited his people, as in the matter of Naboth and his vineyard (21:1-29). In Israel, the people had absolute title to the land as a gift from God. When Ahab wanted to annex a vineyard from his neighbor Naboth and Naboth refused, he was frustrated. Jezebel was familiar with another type of kingship back home: When kings wanted something, they just took it. So she helped Ahab frame Naboth, who was executed on false charges. Ahab took possession of the land, but the Lord would not let him get away with it. He sent Elijah to deliver a death sentence for Ahab and his dynasty.\nThen war flared up again with Aram, and Ahab enlisted Jehoshaphat, the southern king, as his ally (1 Kgs 22:2-4; 2 Chr 18:1-3). Jehoshaphat still believed in the Lord, so he talked Ahab into consulting God’s prophet Micaiah, who prophesied that this battle would end Ahab’s life (1 Kgs 22:5-28; 2 Chr 18:4-27). Ahab tried to escape this fate by wearing ordinary armor and having Jehoshaphat wear royal battle dress as a decoy, but there is no fooling God. An archer’s shot penetrated the joint of Ahab’s armor, and he died, “just as the Lord had promised” (1 Kgs 22:38).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 16:29–22:53; 2 Chr 18:1-34; Mic 6:16",

    "content": "Jezebel\nJezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of Sidon (1 Kgs 16:31), married King Ahab of Israel, probably to confirm a political alliance between their countries. Jezebel promoted Baal worship and demanded absolute rights for the monarchy.\nJezebel influenced Ahab into establishing Baal worship in Samaria and setting up an Asherah pole (16:30-33). She tried to exterminate God’s prophets (18:4) and supported large groups of Baal’s prophets in the royal palace (18:19).\nElijah’s confrontation with Jezebel and Ahab culminated on Mount Carmel (18:19-40), where Elijah challenged Israel to follow the true God. Following a display of God’s power, the Israelites acknowledged God and helped Elijah slaughter the false prophets. When Jezebel heard this, she threatened Elijah, and he fled (19:1-3).\nLater, Jezebel advised her husband about how to steal a vineyard from his neighbor Naboth. When Naboth wouldn’t sell it, Jezebel coldly devised a plan to falsely convict Naboth of cursing God and the king, and he was executed. Ahab seized the vineyard, but God sent Elijah to pronounce judgment on Jezebel and Ahab (21:20-24). Ahab soon died (22:29-40), but Jezebel survived throughout her son Ahaziah’s reign. She was later executed when Jehu exterminated the ruling family, and God’s sentence against her was fulfilled (2 Kgs 9:30-37).\nJezebel’s corrupt influence spread to the southern kingdom of Judah when her daughter Athaliah married Jehoram, King Jehoshaphat’s son (see 2 Kgs 8:18, 26-27).\nThe long-standing association of her name with evil is seen in Revelation 2:20, where the name Jezebel is used to label a prophetess who seduced the Christians of Thyatira to commit sexual sins and eat things sacrificed to idols.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 16:31–21:28; 2 Kgs 9:1-37; Rev 2:20",

    "content": "Elijah\nElijah from Tishbe served as prophet of Israel during the reigns of Ahab and Ahaziah (874–852 BC). His name means “my God is Yahweh,” and his ministry involved demonstrating that the Lord is the one true God and calling Israel back to the Lord.\nUnder Ahab and Jezebel, Israel began worshiping Baal, a Canaanite fertility god of storm and rain, so God sent a drought upon Israel (1 Kgs 17:1). Elijah hid until the drought ended, and he was sustained by God. During that time, he lived with a widow in Zarephath, a town in Jezebel’s home territory of Sidon. The widow’s son died, but Elijah prayed for him and he was revived (1 Kgs 17:8-24).\nIn the third year of drought, Elijah challenged Baal’s prophets to a contest on Mount Carmel to demonstrate the identity of the true God (1 Kgs 18:1-40). The prophets of Baal called on Baal in vain, becoming frantic to induce him to appear, while Elijah made fun of Baal. When it was Elijah’s turn, he poured water over his sacrifice and prayed a simple, powerful prayer. Fire immediately consumed the offering. In response, the people of Israel worshiped the Lord and, at Elijah’s direction, killed Baal’s prophets. Then Elijah prayed for rain, and the drought ended (1 Kgs 18:41-46).\nEven with such tremendous displays of God’s power, Ahab and Jezebel continued to lead Israel astray. Jezebel was furious that her prophets had been killed (1 Kgs 19:1-2). She threatened Elijah, who fled to the desert and asked God to take his life. Instead, an angel nourished him until he reached Mount Sinai. Elijah complained that he was the only remaining prophet of the Lord and that his life was at risk. God encouraged him in a quiet voice, gave him good news, then recommissioned him for service (1 Kgs 19:3-18).\nElijah was single-minded in his devotion to the true God. He had an assistant named Elisha whom he trained well. At the end of Elijah’s earthly existence, rather than dying, he was caught up into heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kgs 2:11-12). Elisha inherited Elijah’s prophetic mantle and continued the task of confronting false worship in Israel (see 2 Kgs 2:1–9:13; 13:14-25).\nThe Old Testament closes with the expectation that Elijah would return before the day of the Lord (Mal 4:5-6), an expectation that John the Baptist fulfilled, at least in part (see Matt 11:7-14; 17:10-13; Luke 1:17). Elijah appeared with Moses at Jesus’ transfiguration (Matt 17:1-9). In Revelation 11:3-12, one of the two witnesses seems either to be Elijah himself or to be modeled after Elijah. Elijah’s life illustrates God’s kindness and the effectiveness of prayer (Luke 4:25-26; Rom 11:2-6; Jas 5:17-18).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 17:1–19:21; 21:1-29; 2 Kgs 1:1–2:25; 9:36; 10:10, 17; 2 Chr 21:12-15; Mal 4:5-6; Matt 11:14; 16:14; 17:1-13; 27:45-49; Mark 6:15; 8:28; 9:2-13; 15:33-36; Luke 1:17; 4:26; 9:28-36; John 1:19-28; Rom 11:1-6; Jas 5:17",

    "content": "Arameans\nThe Arameans were a Semitic group, descendants of Shem (Gen 10:22-23; cp. Gen 22:20-21). Bethuel and Laban were known as Arameans (Gen 25:20; 28:1-7). Jacob lived for some twenty years with them in Aramean territory (Gen 28–31; Hos 12:12), and the people of Israel remembered that their forefathers were (at least culturally) Arameans (Deut 26:5).\nWhen the Arameans emerged into history around the time of Abraham, they were settled around the central Euphrates, from which they spread out to the east, west, and north. By around 1100 BC, Aramean tribes had spread throughout Syria and had expanded into northern Transjordan. They set up a number of powerful Aramean city-states, including Zobah and Damascus, that came into conflict with the Israelites beginning in the time of David (see 2 Sam 8:3-8; 10:6-25).\nAfter Solomon’s death and the division of Israel into northern and southern kingdoms, Aramean Damascus became a powerful and opportunistic player in the political struggles between the two states. When war broke out between Israel and Judah in the years 890–880 BC, King Asa of Israel sought aid from Ben-hadad I of Damascus (1 Kgs 15:18-19). Roughly thirty years later, in the early 850s BC, Ben-hadad invaded Israel, but Ahab defeated him both at Samaria (20:1-21) and at Aphek the following year (20:22-34). After three years of peace between Israel and Damascus, hostilities broke out again in 853 BC, resulting in the battle in which Ahab was killed (22:29-37). Aramean Damascus continued to inflict losses on the kingdom of Israel for the next several decades (see 2 Kgs 8:28-29; 12:17-18; 13:1-7).\nDuring this period, the Aramean city-states began feeling pressure from Assyria. Damascus was first defeated by Assyria around 838 BC and was forced to become a tribute-paying vassal of Assyria in 803 BC. The resulting weakness of Damascus helped enable Jehoash (798–782 BC) to defeat the Arameans and expel them from Israel’s territory around 795 BC (2 Kgs 13:14-25). Later, Jeroboam II (793–753 BC) was able to force Damascus to pay tribute to him (see 2 Kgs 14:28).\nAround 738 BC the Arameans of Damascus joined forces with Israel to subjugate Judah. They captured much land, but their siege of Jerusalem was unsuccessful (2 Kgs 16:5; see also 2 Chr 28:5). At this time of seeming success for Damascus, the prophets Isaiah and Amos predicted the city’s doom (Isa 8:4; 17:1; Amos 1:3-5). But rather than trust in God, King Ahaz of Judah turned to the Assyrians for protection, who responded to his gifts by sacking Damascus and exiling its population in 733/732 BC (2 Kgs 16:7-11). Damascus was no longer an independent city-state.\nThe language of the Arameans, Aramaic, eventually became the language for diplomacy and administration all over the Near East (see, e.g., 2 Kgs 18:26). During the Exile, the Jews adopted the Aramaic language; portions of Ezra and Daniel are written in Aramaic. Aramaic was the lingua franca from Egypt to India during the Persian period and was widely spoken in Palestine in Jesus’ day (see Mark 5:41; 1 Cor 16:22).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 10:22-23; 22:20-21; 25:20; 28:1-7; Deut 26:5; 2 Sam 8:3-4; 10:17-19; 1 Kgs 15:18; 1 Kgs 20:1-34; 22:29-37; 2 Kgs 13:25; 16:9-13; 17:24-34; Hos 12:12; Amos 1:5",

    "content": "Elisha\nElisha the prophet was Elijah’s follower and successor in the northern kingdom of Israel during the late 800s BC, a time when the leaders and people of the northern kingdom turned their backs on God and worshiped the Canaanite god Baal. Ahab and Jezebel were eager worshipers of this false god, as were their descendants who succeeded them on the throne. Elisha’s ministry (853–798 BC) began as King Ahab’s reign was ending; he was an important part of God’s strategy to bring down Israel’s idol-worshiping leaders.\nElisha started his work as a disciple of Elijah and was the one God chose to take Elijah’s place (1 Kgs 19:15-21; 2 Kgs 2:1-18). After Elijah was taken into heaven, Elisha’s miracles demonstrated that God’s great power was with him.\nElisha’s miracles often involved water. He purified the putrid water of a spring near Jericho (2 Kgs 2:19-22) and caused an ax head to float (2 Kgs 6:1-7). When King Joram’s water supply ran out in enemy territory, Elisha correctly predicted that an ample water supply would emerge (2 Kgs 3:4-20). Baal supposedly controlled water, so these signs showed that the Lord, and not Baal, was really in charge.\nElisha displayed God’s power by helping people in tangible ways. He helped a poor woman by miraculously causing her jars to fill with olive oil (2 Kgs 4:1-7). He predicted to a woman from Shunem that she would have a son, and he brought the boy back to life when he died (2 Kgs 4:8-37). He cured an Aramean general named Naaman of leprosy (2 Kgs 5:1-19). And he provided food for people who needed it (2 Kgs 4:38-44).\nElisha was part of God’s plan to bring judgment on the northern kingdom. He anointed both Jehu of Israel and Hazael of Aram (2 Kgs 8:7-15; 9:1-13), who brought a violent end to the leaders of Israel who encouraged the worship of Baal (see 1 Kgs 19:15-18).\nElisha’s miracles anticipated Jesus’ ministry. Jesus also cured lepers (Matt 8:1-4), raised the dead (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 7:11-17; John 11:1-44), and miraculously provided food (Matt 14:13-21; 15:32-38). Jesus mentioned the healing of Naaman as a precedent for his reaching out to Gentiles, to show that God’s mercy is not restricted to Israelites (Luke 4:27).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 19:15-21; 2 Kgs 2:1–9:13; 13:14-21; Luke 4:27",

    "content": "Jeroboam II\nJeroboam II, son of Jehoash, reigned over Israel for 41 years (793–753 BC), longer than any other northern king. He followed the evil example of his (unrelated) namesake, Jeroboam I (2 Kgs 14:23-24). During his era the northern kingdom reached its greatest extent and experienced its greatest prosperity since Solomon (archaeological evidence from Jeroboam’s capital, Samaria, suggests the opulence of Israel’s royal house during his reign). On a human level, an explanation for Israel’s newfound prosperity was that Assyria experienced a decline in power during this time, allowing the northern kingdom to expand. The prophet Jonah, however, predicted this prosperity as the fulfillment of God’s promise (14:25). Even though Jeroboam’s reign came after 150 years of apostasy in the northern kingdom, God still exhibited his faithful love by offering Israel his mercy (14:26-27).\nWhile the reign of Jeroboam II produced great wealth, it was not accompanied by justice. The rich landowners oppressed the less wealthy and forced small landowners to migrate from their farms to the cities. There was an increase in government corruption, economic depression, and political weakness, and Israel’s spiritual state continued to degenerate. God raised up prophets to challenge the leaders and people of Israel during this time. Amos and Hosea prophesied against Israel’s vast corruption. Amos was particularly scathing in his attacks on the rich for oppressing the poor. He mentions Jeroboam’s impending death and the punishment that was coming upon Israel (Amos 7:10-17).\nWhen Jeroboam II died, the northern kingdom rapidly declined. In the following years (753–722 BC), six kings ruled in rapid succession, and most of them were assassinated. In 722 BC, about 30 years after the end of Jeroboam II’s reign, Assyria destroyed the northern kingdom and deported its people, thus properly bringing judgment on the sins of Jeroboam II and other northern kings.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 13:13; 14:16, 23-29; Hos 1:1; Amos 1:1; 7:10-17",

    "content": "Ahaz\nAhaz reigned in Judah during a turbulent period (743–715 BC). His father Jotham (2 Kgs 15:32-38; 2 Chr 27:1-9) and son Hezekiah (2 Kgs 18:1-8) were praised for their obedience to the Lord, but Ahaz was evil, even sacrificing one of his sons to false gods.\nAhaz’s reign was marked with conflict. King Pekah of Israel and King Rezin of Aram (Syria) wanted him to join a coalition against Assyria, but he refused. So Pekah and Rezin turned against Judah and won substantial victories, which severely frightened Ahaz. Isaiah the prophet encouraged Ahaz to rely on the Lord, but Ahaz refused (Isa 7).\nRevealing his lack of trust in the true God, Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-pileser III for help (2 Kgs 16:7-9). Ahaz made Judah dangerously dependent on Assyria, and Judah effectively became a vassal state. The Assyrian king subsequently defeated the Arameans in a two-year campaign (734–732 BC) and killed Rezin. He subdued Israel and incorporated great tracts of Pekah’s land into the Assyrian Empire (15:29).\nAhaz became an eager servant of Assyria. He adopted many religious innovations based on Assyrian models. Ahaz visited Tiglath-pileser III in Damascus, where he saw an Assyrian altar and sent a model of it to Jerusalem, where a similar altar was built, replacing the original bronze altar (16:10-18). Several other Temple alterations also indicate Ahaz’s defection from faith in the Lord.\nAhaz illustrates why the people of Judah were finally exiled. He did not comport himself appropriately as a king (Deut 17:14-20), and he did not worship the Lord. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son Hezekiah (2 Kgs 16:20).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 15:38–16:20; 2 Chr 27:9–28:27; Isa 7:1-25",

    "content": "Hezekiah\nHezekiah, who reigned from 728 to 686 BC was one of Judah’s best kings. Hezekiah’s father, Ahaz, betrayed the Lord, but Hezekiah promoted true worship of God. Reversing the damage done by Ahaz, he repaired the Temple doors, had the Levites sanctify themselves, and reinstated religious ceremonies. He brought sacrifices, restored the priestly Temple service, and invited people throughout Judah and Israel to celebrate Passover in Jerusalem (2 Chr 29–30). After the celebration, he faithfully destroyed pagan worship sites.\nSoon after Hezekiah started ruling, the Assyrians under Shalmaneser V and his successor Sargon II defeated the northern kingdom, deported its inhabitants, and brought in foreign residents (722 BC). When Sargon II died in 705 BC, his son Sennacherib came to power, triggering widespread rebellion. Hezekiah stopped paying the tribute that his father Ahaz had paid (2 Kgs 18:7; see 16:7). As a result, in 701 BC Sennacherib invaded Judah. Hezekiah tried to appease the Assyrian ruler by sending a vast tribute payment, but the attempted return to servitude failed and the Assyrian forces threatened Jerusalem and mocked Hezekiah’s reliance on the Lord (18:17-35). Hezekiah responded with grieving and supplication. The Lord, speaking through Isaiah the prophet, assured Hezekiah that his prayers had been heard and that Sennacherib would not conquer Jerusalem (19:1-34).\nAround that same time, Hezekiah became seriously ill (20:1-11). Isaiah told him to prepare for death, but Hezekiah turned to the Lord and prayed for healing. The Lord promised him fifteen more years as well as deliverance from the Assyrians. When he had recovered, Hezekiah unwisely hosted the rebel Babylonian king Merodach-baladan in his palace, showing him the Temple treasures and seeking support from Babylon rather than the Lord. Isaiah predicted that those treasures would be carried off to Babylon (20:12-19).\nAfter the Assyrian threat in 701 BC, Hezekiah’s remaining years were peaceful and prosperous; he died in 686 BC and was succeeded by his son Manasseh.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 18:1–20:21; 2 Chr 28:27–32:33; Isa 36:1–39:8",

    "content": "Josiah\nJosiah, who reigned in Judah from 640 to 609 BC, was a godly man, unlike his grandfather Manasseh and his father, Amon. Josiah “turned to the Lord with all his heart and soul and strength, obeying all the laws of Moses” (2 Kgs 23:25).\nThe kingdom of Judah was grossly idolatrous and wicked during Manasseh’s reign (697–642 BC). Despite Manasseh’s own repentance toward the end of his reign, conditions continued to worsen under his son Amon (642–640 BC), who was so bad that his own officials assassinated him, and the eight-year-old Josiah was placed on the throne (21:23-24; 22:1; 2 Chr 33:24–34:1).\nWhen Josiah was sixteen, he began “to seek the God of his ancestor David” (2 Chr 34:3). From that point on, he was dedicated to purifying the worship of the people of God. At twenty, Josiah began eradicating pagan places of worship, especially the despised pagan worship center at Bethel. Josiah fulfilled prophecy (1 Kgs 13:1-3) by destroying its altar and burning the bones of pagan priests to desecrate the site (2 Kgs 23:15-18).\nWhen Josiah was twenty-six, he organized repairs to the Temple (22:3-7). In the process, the priest Hilkiah found the Book of the Law and read it to Josiah, who was devastated by its pronouncements against apostasy (22:8-20). He then sought more fully to obey God’s instructions and to lead the people in worshiping the Lord. He celebrated Passover as the law demanded, destroyed many artifacts used in Baal and sun worship, and eliminated pagan shrines in Judah (23:4-14). In all this, Josiah was apparently supported by the prophets Zephaniah and Jeremiah, who spoke for God during his time.\nJosiah was not sensitive to God’s voice on one significant occasion, however, and it cost him his life (23:29-30; 2 Chr 35:20-25). In 609 BC, Pharaoh Neco marched toward Carchemish to reinforce the Assyrian army against Babylon. Josiah delayed Neco at Megiddo, perhaps wanting to support the Babylonians. Neco insisted that the Lord wanted him to fight Babylon, but Josiah attacked him and was killed in battle. Josiah was greatly mourned by Jeremiah and the people of Judah (2 Chr 35:25).\nThough Josiah was faithful, the people were not; once he died, his sons and successors began to turn away from the Lord. In spite of Jeremiah’s increased efforts, the people did not repent. The turbulent years that followed Josiah’s death soon ended with the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of its citizens to Babylon (605–586 BC).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 13:2; 2 Kgs 21:24–23:30; 2 Chr 33:25–35:27; Jer 1:1-4; 22:13-23; 25:3; 36:2; Zeph 1:1",

    "content": "Assyria\nAssyria was a symbol of terror and tyranny in the Near East for more than three centuries. In the biblical account, we learn about its power and ruthlessness in its treatment of the people of Israel and Judah. But its fortune rose and fell with the strength of its leaders. Eventually, it was overpowered by those who were stronger.\nAshurnasirpal II (885–860 BC)\nAshurnasirpal II possessed all the qualities and defects of his successors to the extreme: He had the ambition, energy, courage, vanity, and magnificence of a ruthless and unrelenting empire builder.\nShalmaneser III (858–824 BC)\nShalmaneser III is well known for the Battle of Qarqar (853 BC), considered the most fully documented event from the ancient world. His invasion of Syria was repelled by a coalition that included King Ahab of Israel and several other states. It was years before Shalmaneser was able to conquer Israel and Syria. King Jehu of Israel is depicted on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III kissing the ground at his feet and offering tribute.\nRepentance during the Time of Jonah\nSometime during the reign of King Jeroboam II in Israel (793–753 BC), the prophet Jonah grudgingly traveled to Nineveh to proclaim judgment (Jon 3–4). Assyria was then in decline, and as Jonah had feared, the king and people of Nineveh listened and repented of their sins. As a result, God granted them a reprieve, which lasted some 150 years.\nTiglath-pileser III (744–727 BC)\nTiglath-pileser III usurped the Assyrian throne and began to recover and consolidate control of all Assyria’s territories. He gained the throne of Babylon as well, establishing Assyria firmly as the dominant military and economic power in the Near East. He demonstrated political prudence not usually found in the ruthless Assyrian monarchs. King Menahem of Israel (752–742 BC) paid him tribute (2 Kgs 15:19-20), as did Tyre, Byblos, and Damascus. Responding to an appeal from King Ahaz of Judah (735–715 BC) to help resist Syria and Israel (2 Kgs 16:5-20), Tiglath-pileser conquered Damascus in 732 BC. (His successor, Shalmaneser V, would destroy Samaria in 722 BC, punctuating the end of the northern kingdom of Israel.)\nSennacherib (705–681 BC)\nSennacherib was occupied throughout his reign in a series of bitter wars. He is especially known in the biblical account for his campaign against Judah and siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC during the reign of King Hezekiah and the ministry of the prophet Isaiah (2 Kgs 18:13–19:37; Isa 36–37).\nAshurbanipal (668–627 BC)\nAshurbanipal captured No-amon (Thebes) in Egypt, thereby realizing the greatest victory in Assyrian history (see Nah 3:3-10). He also established a great library in Nineveh, which was excavated in 1860. Many tablets were found, containing a vast selection of Akkadian material. This library is now one of the principal treasures of the British Museum in London. Very little is known about Ashurbanipal’s reign after 639 BC, since his annals do not extend beyond that year. However, allusions in state correspondence, commercial documents, and prayers addressed to the gods suggest that Assyria was becoming increasingly unstable. When Ashurbanipal died in 627 BC, his empire declined quickly.\nFinal Decline and Destruction\nIn 626 BC, Nabopolassar became king of Babylon (626–605 BC) and formed an alliance with the Medes, making it almost inevitable that Babylon would succeed against Assyria. In 612 BC their combined forces launched a final assault against Nineveh, and after three months of siege the mighty city fell (see Nah 1:8). The last of the Assyrian forces were completely destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (then a general in his father’s army) at the battle of Carchemish in 605 BC.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 15:19–19:37",

    "content": "Babylon\nBabylon, one of the world’s most ancient cities, was the center of the Babylonian civilization and is an enduring symbol for defiant human pride.\nBabylon was founded a few generations after the Flood by Nimrod (Gen 10:8-10), one of history’s first powerful overlords. Babylon takes its name from Babel, a word that means “gate of god” in the Babylonian language. Babylon was probably the location of the tower of Babel (Gen 11:1-9), an early attempt by humanity to construct their own identity apart from the Creator. It was this proud civilization that Abraham and his family left when they traveled out of Ur of the Chaldeans around 2000 BC. Even though Babylon was ruled by many kingdoms throughout the centuries, the city remained a cultural and religious figurehead.\nSumerian Civilization (3200–2000 BC)\nThe first great civilization to flourish in Babylonia was Sumer, centered south of Babylon. The Sumerians invented cuneiform writing, which was used by Mesopotamian cultures for three thousand years.\nThe Akkadian Empire (2334–2154 BC)\nTo the north of Babylon, Akkadian king Sargon I (2339–2279 BC) founded the capital city of Akkad and gained political and cultural supremacy over Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire lasted for nearly two centuries.\nFirst Babylonian Kingdom (1900–1600 BC)\nDuring the period of the Akkadian Empire, Semitic-speaking nomads from Syria called Amurru (“Amorites”), regarded as barbarians by the urbane Babylonians, began migrating into Babylonia, where they eventually established a new Babylonian kingdom under Amorite control. The sixth king of that dynasty was Hammurabi (1792–1750 BC), who enlarged the kingdom significantly. Babylon’s glory, however, was short-lived; the kingdom shriveled under Hammurabi’s son and lasted only another century.\nAssyrian Domination (900–614 BC)\nIn 851 BC Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858–824 BC) entered Babylon but treated the ancient city with respect and left its king on his throne as a vassal. A century and a half later (around 705 BC), a Babylonian vassal-king named Merodach-baladan organized a revolution, and he sent ambassadors to King Hezekiah of Judah for support (see 2 Kgs 20:12-19; Isa 39). Assyria quickly crushed Merodach-baladan’s revolution, and Assyria’s domination continued for another century.\nNeo-Babylonian Empire (612–539 BC)\nThe Chaldean prince Nabopolassar seized the throne of Babylon (625–605 BC) and put an end to the Assyrian Empire. Under his son Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 BC), Babylon was master of the Near East, a city of splendor (see Dan 1–4).\nNebuchadnezzar was eventually succeeded by a high diplomatic official named Nabonidus (555–539 BC), who neglected Babylon and lost its support. When Cyrus II of Persia (559–530 BC) attacked the city in October 539 BC (see Dan 5:30-31 and study note on Dan 5:31), the city gave itself up without a battle. That surrender marked the end of independent Babylon.\nThe Symbolic Enemy of God’s People\nIn 1 Peter and Revelation, Rome is personified as “Babylon the Great, Mother of all Prostitutes and Obscenities in the World” (Rev 17:5)—a dreadfully immoral center of wealth and commerce, ruling over the kings of the earth and persecuting God’s people. The kings and merchants of the earth will mourn her demise (Rev 18:9-19), but God’s people will rejoice that their oppression has ended and will worship God freely.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 10:8-9; 11:1-9; 2 Kgs 20:12-19; 24:1–25:30; Isa 39; Dan 1–5; 1 Pet 5:13; Rev 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2-21; 19:2",

    "content": "Asa\nAsa became the third king of Judah after the split of Solomon’s empire into independent kingdoms. Asa succeeded his father, Abijah, after Abijah’s brief kingship (913–910 BC) and reigned for 41 years (910–869 BC).\nIn the beginning of his reign, Asa was a good king. He opposed the worship of false gods in the land, destroyed the Asherah pole that his grandmother Maacah had set up, and removed her remaining political influence (1 Kgs 15:13; 2 Chr 15:16).\nIn these early days, God blessed Asa’s reign with military victory and peace. Asa forced out or defeated all who attempted to conquer, divide, or destroy Judah (2 Chr 14:1-8). Asa’s most astounding conquest was over an Ethiopian leader named Zerah, who attacked Judah with more than a million troops. Because of Asa’s obedience and faithfulness, God gave him a tremendous victory (14:9-15).\nUnfortunately, Asa’s attitude changed toward the end of his life, and he abandoned his trust in God. Baasha, the king of the northern kingdom, attacked Judah with the support of Ben-hadad, king of Aram, and fortified the city of Ramah. Asa paid the king of Aram to change sides and support him rather than Baasha. This meant that Asa had more confidence in a foreign king than in the Lord. Worse, Asa paid Ben-hadad with gold and silver that he had earlier given to the Temple! Asa’s power play worked, and the northern kingdom of Israel had to leave Judah to stave off Ben-hadad’s threat from the north. But the prophet Hanani rebuked Asa for his disbelief in God. Infuriated, Asa had Hanani thrown into prison (16:7-10).\nFor the final years of his reign, Asa became ill with a serious foot disease. “Even with the severity of his disease, he did not seek the Lord’s help but turned only to his physicians” (16:12). Even so, when Asa died he was buried with honor in the royal tombs (16:14).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 15:8-24; 2 Chr 14:1–16:14",

    "content": "Jehoshaphat\nJehoshaphat succeeded his father Asa to become the fourth king of Judah (872–848 BC). Like Hezekiah and Josiah after him, Jehoshaphat trusted the Lord throughout his life and worked to remove most forms of pagan worship from Israel (2 Chr 17:6).\nJehoshaphat continued his father Asa’s religious reforms but reversed his foreign policy. Jehoshaphat discontinued Judah’s war with Israel over their boundaries (see 1 Kgs 22:2) and made an alliance with Ahab. To confirm this alliance, he arranged for his son Jehoram to marry Ahab’s daughter Athaliah (2 Chr 18:1-2; 2 Kgs 8:18) and supported the north in its wars against the Arameans and Moabites (2 Chr 18:3-34; 1 Kgs 22; 2 Kgs 3:4-27). The prophet Jehu rebuked Jehoshaphat for his unwise alliance with Israel (2 Chr 19:1-3), which resulted in his son Jehoram falling under the influence of Ahab and Jezebel. Jehoram and his son Ahaziah turned Judah toward idol worship.\nYet during his reign, Jehoshaphat kept the worship of the Lord pure. He closed the temples of prostitution (1 Kgs 22:46) and sent teachers of God’s law throughout the land (2 Chr 17:7-9). He also established a system of judges and admonished them to function as the Lord’s representatives so that justice might prevail (19:4-7). He appointed Levites, priests, and family heads to handle cases pertaining to religious practice and to negotiate disputes among citizens (19:8-10).\nBefore going to battle, Jehoshaphat would insist on hearing from a true prophet of the Lord. And in one of the most stirring descriptions of war in the Old Testament, Jehoshaphat preached to the army before entering a battle. As a result, God caused the armies from Ammon, Moab, and their allies to turn against each other (2 Chr 20).\nJehoshaphat died when he was about sixty years old and was buried in Jerusalem. His son Jehoram became Judah’s next king (21:1).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 15:24; 22:1-50; 2 Kgs 3:1-27; 2 Chr 17:1–21:1",

    "content": "Uzziah\nUzziah, son of Amaziah and Jecoliah, reigned over Judah for 52 years (792–740 BC; see 2 Kgs 14:21-22; 15:1-2; 2 Chr 26:1-3). He reigned as co-regent with his father from the age of sixteen for approximately 25 years. Later, when his father was assassinated, Uzziah became the sole ruler. He served as a capable, energetic, and well-organized king who pleased the Lord through most of his reign.\nDuring most of Uzziah’s reign, Jeroboam II ruled the northern kingdom of Israel (793–753 BC). Both kings were successful and brought a long period of prosperity to Israel and Judah. Uzziah successfully fought the Philistines, and he built many fortifications in Jerusalem and throughout Judah. He “sought guidance from the Lord” (2 Chr 26:5), and as long as he did, the Lord blessed him in all his undertakings and he prospered.\nSeveral prophets were active during Uzziah’s reign. Amos and Hosea both prophesied during his life (Hos 1:1; Amos 1:1), though most of their oracles were directed toward the northern kingdom. And the prophet Isaiah received his call the year Uzziah died (Isa 1:1; 6:1).\nUzziah became proud of his many successes and had a sad downfall (2 Chr 26:16). He took upon himself the prerogatives of a priest, entered the holy area of the Temple, and burned incense. The priests tried to stop him from this sin against the Lord, but he angrily rejected their warnings. Because of his disobedience, God struck Uzziah with leprosy and he had to live out the rest of his life in seclusion. Uzziah was buried with his forefathers, but at a distance because of his leprosy (26:23).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 14:21-22; 15:1-7; 2 Chr 26:1-23; Isa 1:1; 6:1; Hos 1:1; Amos 1:1; Zech 14:5",

    "content": "Manasseh\nManasseh, the thirteenth king of Judah (697–642 BC), had a long but notoriously wicked reign (2 Kgs 21:1-18; 2 Chr 33:1-9)—even though his father was the godly king Hezekiah (2 Kgs 20:21).\nIn 697 BC, Manasseh became co-ruler with his father Hezekiah at age twelve (2 Chr 33:1). In 686 BC, Hezekiah died and Manasseh became sole monarch. He reigned a total of fifty-five years (2 Kgs 21:1), longer than any other king in Judah or Israel. Regrettably, he was the most wicked of all the kings of Judah. He rebuilt the high places for pagan worship; he encouraged the worship of Baal, the sun, the moon, and the stars; and he even burnt his son as a child sacrifice (2 Kgs 21:2-9; see 2 Kgs 23:10; Jer 7:31). He allowed divination and sorcery in Judah and “murdered many innocent people until Jerusalem was filled . . . with innocent blood” (2 Kgs 21:16; 24:3-4).\nSurviving Assyrian records note that Manasseh provided men to transport timber from Lebanon to Nineveh for the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (680–669 BC), and he paid tribute to King Ashurbanipal (668–626 BC) after an Assyrian military campaign in Egypt in 667 BC. Manasseh served Assyria more faithfully than he served the Lord.\nBecause of Manasseh’s tremendous sin, God determined to “wipe away the people of Jerusalem as one wipes a dish and turns it upside down” (2 Kgs 21:13). However, Manasseh repented late in life. The Assyrian army captured him, put a hook through his nose, and exiled him to Babylon (2 Chr 33:10-13). There Manasseh turned to the Lord. God heard his prayers, restored him as king, and blessed the rest of his reign as Manasseh sought to restore proper worship of God alone (33:14-17).\nSadly, Manasseh’s sins had infected the people of Judah (33:17), and God did not reverse his determination to judge the kingdom (2 Kgs 23:26; 24:3-4). This indicates just how seriously Manasseh had sinned. Even Jeremiah, one hundred years later, announced: “Because of the wicked things Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem, I will make my people an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth” (Jer 15:4). The destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple and the exile of Judah’s people followed.\nWhen Manasseh died in 642 BC at age 67, he was buried in his own garden (2 Kgs 21:18), rather than with highly regarded leaders such as Jehoiada and Hezekiah (2 Chr 24:15-16; 32:33).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 20:21–21:18; 23:26; 24:3; 2 Chr 32:33–33:20; Jer 15:4",

    "content": "Cyrus II\nCyrus II, king of Persia (559–530 BC), founded the great Persian Empire. His father was king of Persia, a small nation that was subject to Media, and his mother was the daughter of the king of the Medes. Cyrus conquered the Medes in 549 BC and combined the two nations into one. He conquered Lydia in Asia Minor in 547 BC, then turned to the east and brought Parthia and part of India into the Persian Empire. Finally, on October 29, 539 BC, Cyrus conquered the city of Babylon and brought Babylonia into his empire (see Dan 5:30-31).\nAfter conquering Babylon, Cyrus issued a decree that allowed the Jewish people to return home and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. The part of this decree dealing with the Jews has been recorded in 2 Chronicles 36:22-23 and Ezra 1:1-4. This practice is confirmed by the Cyrus Cylinder, a barrel that was discovered at Babylon in 1879–82, which describes Cyrus’s policy regarding conquered peoples.\nIsaiah named Cyrus as Judah’s future deliverer (Isa 44:28–45:13) and even called him the Lord’s anointed (Isa 45:1, Hebrew mashiakh, “messiah”). Israel regarded Cyrus as called and empowered by God to free them. Cyrus was not the Messiah, but what he did served as an example of what the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would later do in setting God’s people free from servitude.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Chr 36:22-23; Ezra 1:1-11; 3:7; 4:1-5; 5:6-17; 6:14-15; Isa 44:28–45:13; 48:14-16; Dan 6:28; 10:1",

    "content": "Ezra\nEzra was a priest and scribe of the high-priestly line of Zadok (Ezra 7:1-5, 11-12; cp. Neh 8:2, 9). He was a leader in Judah following the Jews’ return from exile. As a scribe, Ezra was not just a copyist but a disciplined student of God’s laws (Ezra 7:6) who was qualified to teach, preach, and interpret the Scriptures.\nAs an important official who assisted the king with Jewish affairs in the Persian Empire, Ezra visited Jerusalem around 458 BC, bringing articles for the Temple and the mission of establishing God’s laws and the laws of Persia. One of his first reforms was to confront the sin of intermarriage with pagan neighbors (9:1–10:44). Later, after the city walls were rebuilt in 445 BC (Neh 6:15), Ezra led the community to obey God’s law more fully (Neh 8:13-15).\nEzra honored God through his handling of finances. The Persian king trusted Ezra’s judgment and allowed him to ask for more money when needed (Ezra 7:15-20). Ezra gave others the responsibility for financial affairs whenever he could and required strict financial integrity (8:24-30). He identified certain financial resources as holy and belonging to God.\nEzra humbled himself before God when the people began their journey (8:21-23), when he found out about the people’s unholy marriages (9:5-15), and when he gathered those required to divorce their pagan wives (10:6). He always recognized that God’s gracious hand—not his own ability or wisdom—enabled good things to happen (7:6, 9, 28; 8:18, 22, 31; 9:8-9). He studied and lived by God’s Word and taught others to follow what God revealed (7:10). He was a teacher and servant-leader, not a self-important official who lorded it over other people.\nEzra’s piety and dedication, demonstrated through prayer and fasting, put his reforming zeal in proper spiritual perspective. He set the pattern for life in the postexilic Jewish community, making God’s Word and worship central priorities.\nPassages for Further Study\nEzra 7:1–10:44; Neh 8:1-18; 12:1, 26, 36",

    "content": "The Medes and Persians\nThe Medes (around 850–549 BC)\nThe early Medes left no written records. According to an inscription from Shalmaneser III of Assyria (858–824 BC), the Medes had settled around Ecbatana, their capital (modern Hamadan, Iran), by the mid-800s BC. The Medes were renowned horse breeders, so Shalmaneser raided their territory to steal large herds of fine horses. The Medes were subject to the Assyrians until the late 600s, when they gained their independence as Assyria weakened.\nThe Persians (around 700–549 BC)\nAround 700 BC, a small kingdom of Persia was established under Achaemenes, who ruled around 700~675 BC. His son Teispes (675~640 BC) was under the domination of the Medes, who were gathering forces to overthrow Assyria. But trouble for the Medes later freed Teispes from their control. Cambyses (600~559 BC), son of Cyrus I and grandson of Teispes, married the daughter of the Median king Astyages; their son was Cyrus II (559–530 BC), who ascended the throne of Persia in 559 BC.\nThe Medo-Persian Empire (549–331 BC)\nCyrus II fought and defeated his grandfather, Astyages of Media, in 549 BC. He made Ecbatana in Media his capital and set up his archives there (see Ezra 6:1-5). With a Persian father and Median mother, Cyrus II embodied the joining of Media and Persia.\nCyrus exhibited an attitude of benevolence and generosity toward defeated enemies. A capable military leader, Cyrus invaded Asia Minor and defeated Croesus, king of Lydia, and brought the Greek cities of the area into subjection. In 539 BC, he captured Babylon with virtually no resistance and decreed that exiled peoples could return to their homelands to rebuild their temples (see Ezra 1:1-4).\nThe son of Cyrus, Cambyses II (529–522 BC), conquered Egypt, but the empire nearly disintegrated when he committed suicide. Cambyses was succeeded by Darius I (521–486 BC), the son of Hystaspes, satrap of Parthia. Darius, an energetic and efficient administrator, put down internal revolts and consolidated the empire into twenty provinces, each under a satrap or “protector of the kingdom,” with inspectors (“the ears of the king”) to check on the activities of the satraps. Darius changed the principal capital of Persia to Persepolis, where a tremendous palace complex was eventually constructed. Darius was a follower of Zoroaster and a worshiper of Ahura Mazda, the principal god of Zoroastrianism, as were Xerxes and Artaxerxes after him.\nDuring the latter part of Darius’s reign, he suffered defeat at the hands of the Greeks at Marathon (491 BC).\nDarius was succeeded by his son Khshayarsha, better known as Xerxes in Greek or as Ahasuerus in Hebrew. During his rule (486–465 BC), the Persian fleet was defeated by the Greeks at Salamis (480 BC).\nThe loss of the empire has been attributed to the cowardice of Darius III (336–330 BC), whose armies were defeated by Alexander the Great at Issus in 333 BC and ultimately at Gaugamela, near modern Erbil (Arbela) in 331 BC.\nPersia and the Bible\nThe earliest mention of Persia in Israel’s history is in Isaiah 44:28–45:13, a predictive prophecy that was given to Isaiah more than 150 years before Cyrus captured Babylon and decreed the return of the exiled Jews to Jerusalem. The rest of the biblical references to Persia occur in the later period of Old Testament history (Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther) and in the writings of the exilic and postexilic prophets (Daniel, Zephaniah, Haggai). Persia is portrayed in Scripture as a stern but usually benevolent master that generally let the Jews govern themselves and worship in their own way. Nevertheless, the fact that the postexilic community of Judea was under foreign rule was never far from their minds.\nPassages for Further Study\nEzra 4:5-7",

Nehemiah improved the morale and strength of God’s people in the midst of difficulty.\nBefore Nehemiah returned to Judea, he was cup-bearer to Persian king Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC). The cup-bearer brought the king his wine (tasting it first to make sure it wasn’t poisoned) and was his trusted confidant and adviser. Nehemiah heard reports about Jerusalem’s sad state and, moved with compassion, he asked the king’s permission to return to Judea to help his people. The king responded favorably and made him governor of the province of Judea for twelve years to aid his fellow Jews and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (Neh 1:1–2:8).\nNehemiah had the support of the Persian king, but he faced opposition from the inhabitants of the land. These people of mixed heritage were the ancestors of the New Testament Samaritans. Nehemiah showed great courage and skill as he successfully helped the people of Judea rebuild the walls that protected Jerusalem.\nNehemiah had a strong personal faith, as seen by his prayers (Neh 1:4-11; 2:4) and his confidence in divine guidance and help (2:8, 18, 20). He also advocated economic justice: He rebuked a few rich Judeans who were exploiting a food shortage by exacting high interest from their poorer relatives, and he provided an example of better conduct (Neh 5).\nNehemiah was vitally concerned about the people’s faithfulness, and he individually confronted men who had married pagan women (13:23-29). He had a strong interest in maintaining Temple worship, and he led the Jewish community to pledge support for Temple personnel and to provide offerings (10:32-39). He also reformed Sabbath observance (13:15-22).\nAlthough there were still problems at the end of his tenure in Jerusalem (see Neh 13), Nehemiah was an effective leader who restored a national and religious identity to the Jewish settlers in a period of political and economic weakness.\nPassages for Further Study\nNeh 1:1–7:73; 8:9-10; 10:1–13:31",

    "content": "Esther\nEsther was queen of Persia during the reign of Xerxes I (486–465 BC). She was a woman of the Diaspora (“scattering”), descended from Jews who had been scattered among the nations at the time of the Exile. Her family had not returned to the land of Judah, as some Jews had (see Ezra 1–2), but had chosen to stay in the land of Persia, like many others. Noting how important her cousin Mordecai was in the Persian government makes us guess that her family had grown rich and comfortable.\nEsther was an orphan and was raised by her cousin Mordecai, who became a minor official in the Persian government in Susa. She became queen after King Xerxes became displeased with Queen Vashti for refusing to attend a banquet when commanded to do so (Esth 1:11-12).\nAfter Esther’s coronation, she discreetly won Xerxes’ confidence by informing him of an assassination plot (2:21-23). This later enabled her to rescue her people from a massacre planned by Haman, a high official to the king. Through her wise advice and brave action, Esther exposed Haman, he was executed, and the Jewish people were rescued. The Jewish Festival of Purim was instituted to celebrate these events.\nPassages for Further Study\nEsth 2:7-20; 4:4–5:8; 7:1–9:32",

He inherited a vast empire from his father and his maternal grandfather (Cyrus II), but he was unable to govern Persia effectively due to his cruelty and instability.\nEarly in Xerxes’ reign, Egypt and Babylon revolted against Persian rule. Xerxes crushed the revolts and kept the tax revenues flowing, but his brutal treatment of his subjects began cementing his reputation for despotism.\nIn the third year of his reign, Xerxes convened an assembly of his leaders to plan an invasion of Greece. (The book of Esther begins with a banquet that probably reflects that situation.) In 480 BC the legendary but ill-fated campaign to conquer Greece began. Xerxes’ tyrannical cruelty is exemplified by two accounts that Herodotus records from this campaign. When he and his armies reached the Hellespont (the waterway connecting the Black Sea with the Mediterranean), his engineers built a bridge so his armies could cross, but a storm destroyed the bridge. Xerxes responded by beheading the engineers and whipping the water before building a stronger bridge. Later in the campaign, after he had burned Athens, his fleet was defeated at Salamis. Xerxes responded by executing the admiral of the Phoenician fleet, and the Phoenicians and Egyptians deserted him. Only the Persian fleet remained, and it was defeated by the Greeks in 479 BC. Xerxes was forced to retreat. Afterward, Xerxes turned his attention to matters at home, such as massive building projects at Susa and Persepolis, and the events recorded in Esther.\nXerxes had reason to worry that assassins would try to kill him. According to Esther 2:21-23, Mordecai thwarted an assassination plot, which later led to Xerxes publicly honoring Mordecai. After Xerxes was again defeated by the Greeks at the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC and stripped of territory, another assassination plot by his court officials succeeded, and his reign ended ignominiously in 465 BC.\nPassages for Further Study\nEzra 4:6; Esth 1:1-22",

The Old Testament hints at the accuser’s demonic character, but it was between the times of the Old Testament and the New Testament that Satan became identified with the serpent in Eden (see Wisdom of Solomon 2:24). The New Testament refers to the chief demon as “(the) Satan” (Rev 20:2), along with numerous other names such as the devil (Matt 4:1-11), the tempter (1 Thes 3:5), Beelzeboul, the ruler of demons (see textual notes at Matt 12:24; Luke 11:15), the evil one (Matt 13:19, 38; 1 Jn 2:13-14; 3:12; 5:18), Beliar (see textual note at 2 Cor 6:15), the deceiver (Rev 12:9), the great seven-headed dragon and serpent of old (Rev 12:3, 9; 20:2), a murderer, and the father of lies (John 8:44).\nSatan incited David’s census (1 Chr 21:1; cp. 2 Sam 24:1), tempted and betrayed Jesus (Mark 1:12-13; John 13:27), desired to test Peter as he had tested Job (Luke 22:31), enslaved sinners (Acts 26:17-18), and deceitfully opposed God’s people (1 Cor 7:5; 2 Cor 11:14). The adversary of God’s people will be overcome in the end, when God defeats and imprisons him (Rev 12:9; 20:2, 10).\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 22:22, 32; 1 Chr 21:1; Job 1:6–2:7; Zech 3:1-4; Matt 4:1-10; 12:24; 13:19, 38-39; 16:23; Mark 1:13; 4:15; Luke 4:6; 10:17-20; 11:15; 22:3, 31; John 8:44; 12:31; 13:2, 27; 16:11; Acts 13:9-10; 26:17-18; Rom 16:20; 1 Cor 7:5; 2 Cor 2:10-11; 4:4; 6:15; 11:13-15; 1 Thes 3:5; 2 Thes 2:2-12; Heb 2:14; Jas 4:7; 1 Pet 5:8; 1 Jn 2:13-14; 3:12; 5:18; Rev 12:3, 9; 20:2, 10",

    "content": "Isaiah\nIsaiah was a Judean prophet during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. He was the son of Amoz (Isa 1:1) and was possibly related to King Amaziah. He lived in Jerusalem, was well educated, and had deep insight into human nature. He had a long ministry (about 740~685 BC); as Judah’s political and religious counselor, he had access to kings and was apparently the court historian (2 Chr 26:22; 32:32). Isaiah’s wife was called a “prophetess” (see Study Note on Isa 8:3); their sons were Shear-jashub (7:3) and Maher-shalal-hash-baz (8:3).\nIsaiah opposed social and political evil at all levels. He censured fortune-tellers. He rebuked kings for their willfulness and indifference. He denounced wealthy, influential people who ignored their responsibilities. And he exhorted everyone to obey God’s covenant. Isaiah opposed Canaanite idolatry and insincere religious observances (1:10-17; 29:13), proclaiming judgment and declaring that only a righteous remnant would survive (6:11-13). He foretold the coming Messiah, the peaceful prince of God’s kingdom (9:6-7; 11:1-11) who was also an obedient, suffering servant (53:3-12). The book of Isaiah has more overtones of the New Testament than any other Old Testament book and is frequently cited by New Testament authors.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 19:1–20:19; 2 Chr 26:22; 32:20, 32; Isa 1:1–66:24; Matt 3:3; 4:14-16; 8:17; 12:17-21; 13:14-15; 15:7-9; Mark 1:2-3; 7:6-7; Luke 3:4-6; 4:17-19; John 1:23; 12:38-41; Acts 8:28-34; 28:25-27; Rom 9:27-29; 10:15-16, 20-21; 15:12; Gal 4:27",

    "content": "Jeremiah\nJeremiah, a prophet in Jerusalem before its destruction in 586 BC, is sometimes called the “weeping prophet” because he shared his personal struggles and sorrows as he delivered God’s messages.\nJeremiah was born in Anathoth, near Jerusalem, during Manasseh’s reign. His father was Hilkiah of Benjamin. Jeremiah received his calling as a prophet during the thirteenth year of Josiah’s reign (627 BC). At first, Jeremiah retreated from his call (Jer 1:6), but God assured Jeremiah that he would tell him what to say and would guide and protect him despite opposition (Jer 1:7-8, 18-19).\nJeremiah warned the kings and people of Judah to repent in order to avoid exile. They had broken God’s covenant, primarily through idolatry (Jer 10:1-16), and as a result, they were subject to the consequences (Deut 27–28). They rejected God’s invitation to repent, so Jeremiah later delivered messages that God’s judgment had become inevitable.\nJeremiah was particularly hated by Judah’s leaders. King Jehoiakim held Jeremiah in contempt and tried to silence him. King Zedekiah secretly sought Jeremiah’s advice, but bowed to his administrators when they wanted to silence the prophet. God’s word could not be silenced, however. The promised judgment came in 586 BC: Jerusalem was sacked, the Temple was destroyed, and Judah’s leaders were killed or exiled to Babylon.\nNebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, knew of Jeremiah and was favorably disposed toward him (Jer 39:11-12). As a result, the captain of the Babylonian army allowed Jeremiah to stay with the remnant in Judah. Jeremiah counseled those who remained behind to submit to Babylon, even when Judean terrorists killed Gedaliah, the governor appointed by Babylon. The Judeans rejected Jeremiah’s advice and fled to Egypt. Jeremiah was taken with them, and little more is ever heard about Jeremiah. According to tradition, he was stoned to death by Jewish exiles in Tahpanhes, Egypt.\nJeremiah suffered continual rejection, imprisonment, and physical abuse during his life, but his ministry was not entirely negative. He foretold that the Exile would be temporary (25:1-14) and that God would establish a new covenant with his people (31:31-34). This promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ (Luke 22:20).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Chr 35:25; 36:12, 21; Jer 1:1-10; Jer 13:1-14; 18:1-12; 19:1–20:6; 24:1-10; 26:1–29:32; 32:1-15; 36:1–44:30; Dan 9:2; Matt 16:14; 27:9",

    "content": "Baruch\nBaruch the son of Neriah was a royal scribe in Jerusalem who served as secretary for Jeremiah the prophet. His brother Seraiah was a “staff officer” in Zedekiah’s administration (Jer 51:59-64). Baruch’s family evidently ranked highly in the administration of Judah.\nIn the fourth year of King Jehoiakim of Judah (605 BC), God instructed Jeremiah to record the messages he had given to Israel, Judah, and the other nations (36:1-3). Jeremiah sent for Baruch, who wrote the prophecies down (36:4) and read the words to the people (36:8-19). When the message reached Jehoiakim, he destroyed the scroll and called for Baruch’s and Jeremiah’s arrest (36:21-26). But they had gone into hiding, where Jeremiah repeated the prophecies and Baruch again wrote them down (36:27-32).\nAt about that time, God gave Baruch a personal message through Jeremiah (Jer 45). Baruch might have been troubled about the loss of career prospects or personal comfort resulting from his association with Jeremiah. God comforted Baruch with an assurance of protection and instructed him not to seek “great things” for himself, because the promise of Judah’s destruction was certain.\nWhen Jerusalem was destroyed in 586 BC, Baruch stayed with Jeremiah and the others who remained in the land. Apparently Baruch was viewed as influential: The rebel leaders wanted to go to Egypt and when Jeremiah warned them against it (Jer 42), they accused Baruch of persuading Jeremiah. The leaders did not listen but took Baruch and Jeremiah with them to Egypt (43:1-7). We do not know how, when, or where Baruch died. One tradition records that he was taken to Babylon when Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt. It is also possible that Baruch died in Egypt.\nAlthough God warned Baruch not to pursue great things, and he seemed to die without honor, his legacy might in fact be the book of Jeremiah, which he clearly had a hand in producing—a book that warns of judgment and eloquently expresses the hope for the new covenant (31:31-34).\nIn 1975, a clay impression (bulla) formed from a scribe’s seal was found with the words “[Belonging to] Berechiahu, son of Neriahu, the scribe” (Berechiahu is the long form of the name Baruch). Each scribe and government official had a unique seal bearing his name, with which he would seal documents to verify their authenticity—the ancient equivalent of a signature. The seal would be pressed into soft clay to form an impression (bulla), which was affixed to the signed document. The bulla of Baruch dates from the time of Jeremiah and Baruch; other bullae that were found include the names of several other individuals in Jeremiah (e.g., “Gemariah, son of Shaphan,” 36:10-12, 25; Ishmael, 40:7–41:10). Most scholars have concluded that the Baruch bulla was in fact formed by the seal of Baruch, Jeremiah’s scribe. These bullae, seemingly insignificant artifacts of an ancient civilization, provide independent historical verification of some of the details of Jeremiah’s account.\nPassages for Further Study\nJer 32:9-15; 36:1-21, 26-32; 43:1-7; 45:1-5",

    "content": "Ezekiel\nEzekiel, a priest and prophet, was born around 623 BC. He was probably raised in Jerusalem, and he was married (24:16-18). He went into exile in Babylon with Jehoiachin in 597 BC, where he lived by the Kebar River. He was called to be a prophet in Babylon on July 31, 593 BC (1:1). All that we know of his personal life is from the book named after him.\nEzekiel often reinforced his prophetic words with strange actions, such as illustrating his message about the dire lack of food in the final siege of Jerusalem by eating food cooked over dung (4:12). Another time, he lay motionless for 430 days, one day for each year of Israel’s and Judah’s sin (4:4-7). When Ezekiel’s wife died suddenly, he was forbidden to mourn her in public (24:16-18); her death was a solemn warning of what would happen in Judah (24:15-27). Ezekiel’s strange actions were designed to grab people’s attention.\nAt first, Ezekiel’s messages were rejected, but his prophecies were later vindicated as they began to come true and the nation was purged of idolatry. His teaching emphasized holiness, purity, resurrection, and the ritual law. His message of hope encouraged the exiles to remain faithful during the dark hours of their captivity, and after their return it kept them looking toward a greater fulfillment.\nThe circumstances of Ezekiel’s death are unknown, and he is not mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament. The New Testament has over sixty references to Ezekiel’s prophecies, mostly in the book of Revelation. Ezekiel’s prophetic vision extended beyond his immediate future to the final judgment and the great hope of heaven.\nPassages for Further Study\nEzek 2:1-10; 24:15-27",

    "content": "Daniel\nDaniel provides a stirring example of faith, wisdom, and endurance under difficulty and oppression. His life and prophecies affirm that God is in control and will have the final victory despite apparently dominant evil forces.\nDaniel was a young man of Judah’s royal family when the Babylonian army first attacked Jerusalem in 605 BC (Dan 1:3). Daniel was deported to Babylon with Azariah, Hananiah, and Mishael. King Nebuchadnezzar trained these young men, among others, to serve in his growing empire. Daniel and his friends were the brightest and healthiest of the students, so they assumed important positions in Nebuchadnezzar’s court.\nDaniel’s court career lasted nearly seventy years (see Dan 1:21). He quickly established a reputation for intelligence and absolute fidelity to God. When Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream, God revealed its meaning to Daniel, who explained it to the king (Dan 2). Later, Daniel interpreted a second dream about the king’s pride (Dan 4). Daniel urged Nebuchadnezzar to repent, but he did not. As a result, Nebuchadnezzar became temporarily deranged (Dan 4:28-37).\nDaniel always treated the Babylonian king respectfully, and Nebuchadnezzar had high regard for Daniel, whose character and behavior led Nebuchadnezzar to worship the Lord (though not exclusively). Daniel’s faithfulness and prudence encourage later readers in similarly hostile cultures.\nLater, Belshazzar, vice-regent of Babylon, profaned the sacred vessels from the Jerusalem Temple during a banquet (539 BC). A disembodied hand suddenly wrote the words “Mene, Mene, Tekel, and Parsin” on the palace wall, which Daniel interpreted as forecasting Babylon’s imminent end. That same night, Belshazzar was killed by Persians who captured the capital (Dan 5:1-31).\nUnder Darius the Mede (539 BC), Daniel became an administrator of the realm (Dan 6:2). Daniel’s capable management infuriated political enemies, who persuaded Darius to pass a decree forbidding worship of anyone but the king, under penalty of being cast into a lions’ den. To preserve his religious integrity, Daniel violated the law, but he was miraculously unscathed by the lions. Thereafter he was restored to his office (Dan 6:17-28). Daniel’s later visions date from around this time (Dan 10:1, 4).\nDaniel’s prophecies are difficult to understand in detail, but their message is clear: Evil forces are now in power, but God is in control and will save his people. Jesus and New Testament authors cited Daniel, often using his imagery when speaking of the end times (e.g., cp. Dan 7:1-9 and Rev 13:1-10; Dan 7:13 and Rev 1:7; Dan 9:27 and Matt 24:15). Daniel had no doubt that God Most High would be victorious.\nPassages for Further Study\nEzek 14:14, 20; 28:3; Dan 1:1–12:13; Matt 24:15",

Beyond the scriptural record, many ancient Babylonian documents report Nebuchadnezzar’s accomplishments.\nIn 626 BC, Babylon, like Judah, was under the domination of Assyria, but in that year Nabopolassar began a revolt that would change the world. In 612 BC, the Babylonians captured Nineveh, Assyria’s capital, and again defeated the Assyrians at Haran in 609 BC. By the time of this battle, Nabopolassar’s son Nebuchadnezzar played a leading role in the army. In 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar defeated the remnant of the Assyrian army at Carchemish; this victory also pushed the Egyptians back within their borders. In the same year, Nabopolassar died and his son became king.\nFollowing his victory at Carchemish in 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Syria and surrounding areas, including Judah. In that year, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem for the first time (2 Kgs 24:1; 1:1-2). He took away a number of the Temple vessels and some of the leading young citizens of Judah, including Daniel and his three friends. Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem again in 597 BC (2 Kgs 24:10-17). He later besieged Jerusalem in 588 BC and destroyed the city and Temple in 586 BC, exiling most of the remaining people (2 Kgs 25:1-21).\nA detailed and interesting personal description of Nebuchadnezzar is found in Daniel. He brought Daniel and his friends to Babylon in order to educate them in the ways of Babylonia, but God used Daniel to teach Nebuchadnezzar about himself. After being humbled for his great pride (Dan 4:28-33), Nebuchadnezzar acknowledged the Lord’s sovereignty and power (4:34-37), though he probably never worshiped the true God exclusively.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 24:1–25:30; 2 Chr 36:6-21; Jer 21:1-10; 22:24-27; 24:1; 25:1-14; 27:4-8; 28:14; 29:1-23; 32:1-5, 26-31; 34:1-3; 37:1; 39:1-14; 43:10-13; 46:2, 13-26; 49:28-33; 50:17; 51:34; 52:4-16, 28-30; Ezek 26:7; 29:18-20; 30:10-11; Dan 1:1–4:37",

    "content": "The Son of Man\nThe Hebrew and Aramaic idiom “son of man” simply means “human being.” But the majestic yet humble figure in Daniel 7:13-14, who is “like a son of man”—meaning that he looked like a man—also appears to be much more. His exact identity is not specified, but his role is clear: The Most High has appointed him to rule an eternal, universal kingdom that will be over all other nations. He also represents his own people, the holy people of the Most High. They will also share in this son of man’s kingdom over all peoples and nations (see 7:22).\nThe scene surrounding this son of man indicates his divine characteristics. That he comes “with the clouds of heaven” (7:13) indicates his heavenly origin (cp. Ps 68:4; 97:2; Nah 1:3). The Lord God covered himself with a cloud in the book of Exodus (Exod 19:9). God’s people will be caught up into the clouds (1 Thes 4:17) when Jesus returns as he was received into a cloud at his ascension (Acts 1:9). This son of man receives his kingdom with humility and holiness, not arrogantly grasping after it. He is thus opposite in character to the “little horn” (Dan 7:8).\nJesus identifies himself with this Son of Man (Matt 24:30; 26:24; Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27; John 12:34; see also Acts 7:56; Heb 2:6; Rev 1:13; 14:14). Revelation 1:7 likewise yokes this figure with Jesus Christ, the one who was pierced for our sins. God the Father has given Jesus all authority and power to rule over all things (Dan 7:14; Matt 28:18) and to win people from all the nations and kingdoms of the world (Matt 28:19-20). God’s purpose in calling Abraham was to make a great nation through his people and to bless all nations through him (Gen 12:1-3). Jesus fulfilled this promise.\nPassages for Further Study\nDan 7:13-14; Matt 24:30; 26:24; Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27; John 12:34; Rev 1:13; 14:14",

    "content": "The Greeks\nGreek civilization played a major role in the ancient world, and Greek culture was a primary influence on the world into which Jesus was born and in which the New Testament was written.\nMycenaean Civilization (1450–1200 BC)\nThe Mycenaeans lived during the “heroic age” that Greeks later immortalized in the epics of Homer. Their civilization was centered at Mycenae, about thirty miles south of the site of Corinth. The Mycenaeans traded extensively and were successful in war. The Greek gods and myths familiar from later literature have their roots in Mycenaean Greece. Mycenaean documents were written in Linear B, a syllabic script.\nMycenaean civilization ended violently around 1200 BC at the hands of Dorian Greek invaders. The several hundred years which followed have been called the “Greek Dark Ages”—Linear B usage ceased, and there are no written records.\nArchaic Age, City-States (850–546 BC)\nEventually Greek towns and villages began organizing into city-states that controlled entire areas. This era also saw a rise of cooperation and a shared sense of identity among the Greeks; for example, the first Olympic games were held in 776 BC.\nAs trade with the surrounding world increased, the Greeks made contact with the Phoenicians and adopted their script. Homer wrote the Iliad and Odyssey, chronicling the shared memories and myths of the earlier Mycenaean civilization and their gods.\nMany of the city-states looked to a dictator (Greek tyrannos, “tyrant”) to provide political stability. In many places there was also a written constitution that provided a basis for authority in law. Athens, for its part, developed an oligarchy led by the Areopagus Council. Later, Solon, an Athenian statesman, instituted reforms and created the context in which democracy bloomed in later decades.\nPersian Wars, Classical Period (546–336 BC)\nIn 546 BC, the Greek colonies in Asia Minor fell under the rule of Cyrus the Great of Persia. Ionia unsuccessfully attempted to revolt around 500 BC, prompting Darius I to invade the Greek mainland in 492 BC. In the wars that followed, Greek forces were badly outnumbered, but they often outmaneuvered the Persians with superior skill and strategy. In the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, the Greeks soundly defeated the Persians. Ten years later, the Persian army under Xerxes famously crossed the Hellespont while the vast Persian fleet sailed into Greek waters. The Persians burned Athens, but in the end the Greeks were victorious, and Xerxes withdrew.\nAfter the Persian Wars ended, Athens was rebuilt and entered into a remarkable period of greatness. Pericles led Athens to establish a full democracy. Vast buildings were erected on the Acropolis. Athens became wealthy, and Athenian sea power grew. It was a golden age of spectacular achievement in art, thought, literature, and architecture.\nMacedonian Empire, Hellenistic Civilization (336–146 BC)\nPhilip II of Macedon, with ambitions of empire, overwhelmed Athens and Thebes in 338 BC and united Greece into the Macedonian Empire. After Philip was assassinated in 336 BC, his son Alexander took his place. Alexander brutally destroyed a rebellious Thebes in 335 BC, then set out to conquer Babylon and Persia, which he did with lightning speed (cp. Dan 8:5-8). When Alexander suddenly died in 323 BC, his vast territories were divided among four generals. After a period of conflict, three major divisions emerged: Egypt; Asia Minor, Syria, and Babylon; and Macedonia and Achaia.\nAlexander’s conquest spread Greek culture and influence around the ancient world. The resulting conflict between Greek culture and Judaism eventually contributed to the Maccabean revolt in Judea in the 160s BC.\nRoman Rule (168 BC–AD 330)\nRome expanded its power and influence into Greece beginning in 198 BC. In 168 BC, Rome defeated the Macedonians at the battle of Pydna, and in 148 BC, Rome annexed Macedonia as a province. Then, in 146 BC, Rome destroyed Corinth. Greece was now firmly in the grip of Rome, as it continued to be until Constantine made Byzantium the capital of the Roman Empire in AD 330. Greek culture and Roman rule formed the context for the earthly life of Jesus and the beginning of Christianity.\nPassages for Further Study\nDan 8:5-8",

    "content": "Hellenistic Kingdoms\nDuring the 300 years following the death of Alexander in 323 BC, Greek kings continued to rule in the lands he conquered, and Hellenistic religion, culture, and values expanded across civilization. Hellenism provided a context for both Jewish and Greek learning to flourish. But Hellenism also came into conflict with Jewish faith, causing a time of great tribulation for the Jews, especially in the 160s BC. Greek culture eventually combined with Roman rule to set the stage for the coming of the Messiah, as Daniel foresaw. The history of this era is accurately portrayed in several of Daniel’s prophecies (see 7:6; 8:8-14, 21-26; 11:4-45).\nSuccessors (Diadochoi), 323–301 BC\nAfter Alexander died suddenly in 323 BC, a struggle for power and dominance ensued among several of his top generals (Greek diadochoi, “successors”).\nPtolemy I was one of Alexander’s strongest and most capable Macedonian generals. He became satrap of Egypt in 323 BC, the year of Alexander’s death, and he successfully ruled Egypt until his death in 285 BC.\nAntigonus was a leading general in Alexander’s army and served as the energetic regent of a large portion of Alexander’s empire. In 315 BC, Antigonus invaded Syria and Palestine, but his bid to reunite the empire failed and he was killed in battle in 301 BC.\nSeleucus I, another of Alexander’s top generals, became satrap of Babylon in 321 BC. When he heard of Antigonus’s plans to reunite the empire, he fled for protection to Ptolemy in Egypt in 316 BC. After regaining control of Babylon (315 BC) and Syria (312 BC), he ruled until his death in 281 BC.\nLysimachus was satrap of Thrace and Bithynia (in Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey) following the death of Alexander.\nCassander was satrap of Macedonia until 294 BC. The son of Antigonus, Demetrius I, then gained control of Macedonia and Achaia, founding the Antigonid dynasty that ruled there until the Romans took control of Greece after the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC.\nAlexander’s empire was thus divided into four kingdoms ruled by Macedonian Greeks: Egypt, Babylon and Syria, Macedonia and Achaia, and parts of Asia Minor.\nThroughout the 200s BC, the Ptolemies and the Seleucids fought several wars for control of the strategic territory of Palestine. The history of this conflict is accurately portrayed in Daniel 11.\nPtolemies, 323–30 BC\nPtolemy I and his descendants (the “king of the south” in Dan 11) ruled Egypt for nearly three hundred years. After Ptolemy I took control of Judea in 319 BC, he resettled some Jewish people in Alexandria, which became a large and important Jewish community as well as a center for both Jewish and Hellenistic learning and scholarship (the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, was created in Alexandria during this era). Even though the Ptolemies were worshiped as gods and spread Greek culture in Egypt, they were generally tolerant of the Jews and their monotheistic culture. The dynasty of the Ptolemies ended at the death of Cleopatra VII when Rome took control of Egypt in 30 BC.\nSeleucids, 321–64 BC\nSeleucus I and his descendants (the “king of the north” in Dan 11) ruled Syria (and, for a time, Babylon) until the Roman general Pompey annexed Syria in 64 BC. The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies, propagated both Hellenistic culture and the worship of rulers in the areas they controlled; but they were less tolerant of the Jews’ non-participation than the Ptolemies were. After the Seleucid king Antiochus III gained control of Judea around 200 BC, he gave positions and power to Jews who assimilated. His son, Antiochus IV, harshly persecuted the Jews, executing those who kept the Sabbath or copies of the Torah or who would not worship at the altar of Zeus that he erected in the Temple in Jerusalem (note Daniel’s mention of the “sacrilegious object that causes desecration,” Dan 11:31). This persecution provoked the revolt of the Jewish priest Mattathias and his sons, who gained semi-autonomy for the Jewish state for nearly one hundred years under the leadership of their descendants (the Hasmoneans).\nPassages for Further Study\nDan 11:4-39",

    "content": "Zerubbabel\nZerubbabel, a Babylonian-born Jew, relocated to Judea in 538 BC as governor of Jerusalem under Persian rule. Cyrus, the king of Persia, had declared that Jews captured and exiled from Judah might return to their homeland; Zerubbabel led one of the first groups of returning exiles.\nZerubbabel came to Judea with the mission of rebuilding the Temple, and he began by constructing the altar. Sacrifice could begin again once the Holy Place was restored. However, the community of Judea soon ran into opposition from the people in the land, who effectively shut down construction. The Judeans were distracted from the project until the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah encouraged them to begin working again. Zerubbabel was instrumental in leading and organizing the Temple rebuilding effort, which took about six years (520–515 BC).\nExuberant hope surrounded Zerubbabel, who was a direct descendant of King David (1 Chr 3:1-19). Zechariah and Haggai both describe Zerubbabel in messianic terms as the one chosen by God to bring restoration to Israel (Hag 2:21-23; Zech 4:6-7). But Zerubbabel soon disappears from the biblical narrative without explanation. This early governor of Judea was not the Messiah. Rather, Jesus Christ, one of Zerubbabel’s descendants (Matt 1:12), would assume that glorious position.\nPassages for Further Study\nEzra 2:1–6:22; Neh 7:7; Hag 1:12–2:23; Zech 4:1-14; Matt 1:12",

    "content": "Antiochus IV\nAntiochus IV is the most important of all the Seleucid rulers as far as the biblical literature is concerned and is known as one of the cruelest tyrants of all time. He was an enthusiastic believer in the Olympian god Zeus and hoped to unify his territories by spreading Hellenistic culture, law, and religion. In so doing, he came into violent conflict with the Jews in Judea.\nAntiochus IV, born in 215 BC with the name Mithradates, was a son of Antiochus III but was not the designated heir of the Seleucid kingdom. After the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, Mithradates went to Rome as a hostage to guarantee payment of his father’s debts to Rome. His brother, Seleucus IV, then began to reign in 187 BC, but Mithradates used intrigue to get himself released from bondage and when his brother was murdered, he usurped the Seleucid throne, becoming Antiochus IV. He called himself Epiphanes, which means “god manifest.” But his unstable temper led critics to use the pejorative nickname Epimanes, which means “manifestly insane.”\nAntiochus’s drive for Hellenization and his need for finances created a ripe environment for him to sell the Jewish high priesthood to the highest Hellenizing bidder. He sold the office twice, first to Jason in 174 BC and then to Menalaus (who offered a higher bid) in 171 BC.\nAntiochus wanted to gain control of Egypt, so in 169 BC he invaded. Meanwhile, Jason seized control of Jerusalem, attempting to take back the high priest’s office. Jason failed, but Antiochus smelled insurrection, so on his return from a successful campaign in Egypt he attacked Jerusalem, killed and enslaved thousands, and plundered the Temple. The following year, Antiochus again attacked Egypt, but this time Roman forces came to Egypt’s aid, and Antiochus was stopped outside Alexandria. There he was humiliated by the Roman legate Popilius, who famously drew a circle around him and forced him to make a decision to surrender before leaving the circle.\nIn 167 BC, a maddened Antiochus sent troops to massacre the male population of Jerusalem and enslave the women and children. By Antiochus’s edict, Judaism was made illegal under pain of death, and Jews were forced to participate in pagan sacrifices. He evidently thought that destroying the Jewish nation would secure his borders and strengthen his Hellenization program. Instead, it had the opposite effect: Open rebellion broke out later that same year in the village of Modein near Jerusalem. When the king’s representative came to Modein to enforce the edict banning Judaism, a Jewish priest named Mattathias killed him and then fled with his followers to the surrounding hills. This sparked the Maccabean rebellion, in which Mattathias’s sons gained control of Jerusalem and cleansed the Temple in 164 BC. They eventually achieved semi-independence for Judea.\nAntiochus was already considered insane by many, but the success of the Maccabees and Antiochus’s inability to suppress the Jewish revolt drove him further into madness. He withdrew to Persia where he died in 164 BC.\nPassages for Further Study\nDan 11:21-35",

    "content": "Maccabees\nThe Maccabees (meaning, “hammers”) successfully led a revolt against Antiochus IV in response to his persecution of the Jews. They and their descendants (called Hasmoneans) ruled Judea for nearly a hundred years and helped form Jewish society as we see it in the time of Jesus.\nThe Maccabean Revolt (166–142 BC)\nWhen Antiochus IV made the practice of Judaism punishable by death in 167 BC, many Jews acquiesced, while others passively resisted and paid with their lives. Soon, more active resistance arose. When a representative of Antiochus IV came to the town of Modein to require the Jews to perform a pagan sacrifice, a priest named Mattathias killed him and then said, “Everyone who is zealous for the law of Moses and wants to obey the covenant, follow me!” (1 Maccabees 2:27). He then fled to the mountains with his sons and some other followers.\nMattathias, who was very old, soon died, but before his death, he appointed his son Judas to lead the revolt. Judas was a tactical genius and charismatic commander. He, his brothers, and their followers succeeded in defeating Seleucid attacks and liberating most of Judea. After gaining control of Jerusalem, Judas and his band of rebels immediately set about to cleanse the Temple and restore the daily sacrifices, so that daily worship could be resumed. This restoration and rededication was then memorialized in the Festival of Dedication or Lights (Hanukkah). Judas opposed the appointment of a Hellenistic high priest and sought additional political freedom. He defeated the Seleucid army that was dispatched to put down the uprising, but the Seleucid king responded by sending a much larger army. Most of Judas’s men deserted, and Judas was killed in the battle of Elasa (160 BC).\nAfter Judas was killed, the Maccabees regrouped under his younger brother Jonathan, who was a skilled politician and commander. Over the next few years the Maccabees regained control of Judea once more. Jonathan secured the high priesthood and allied himself with Rome. But the Seleucid general Tryphon tricked him, took him hostage, and murdered him in 143 BC.\nAnother brother, Simon, followed Jonathan as leader of the Maccabees. In 142 BC, Simon extracted a treaty from Seleucid king Demetrius II, whereby Judea became independent. Simon retained the office of high priest, and it became a hereditary position for his family. Simon was assassinated by his son-in-law in 135 BC.\nHasmonean Rule (142–63 BC)\nThe rule of Mattathias’s son Simon marks the transition from the Maccabean rebel movement to the Hasmonean dynasty, named for Mattathias’s great-grandfather Asmoneus. Simon’s descendants ruled Judea for close to a hundred years. This era saw the increasing Hellenization of Jewish political leadership. At the same time, the Pharisees gained popularity as they sought to preserve orthodox Judaism. Meanwhile, separatist groups such as the Essenes removed themselves completely from Jewish society. Toward the end of this period, the struggle for control between two brothers, Aristobulus and Hyrcanus II, led to political instability and provided Rome an opportunity to bring peace and assert control.\nRoman Rule (beginning 63 BC)\nIn 63 BC, the Roman general Pompey marched on Jerusalem, and Judea became a tributary to Rome. Judea then entered a period of relative peace. With the end of Hasmonean rule, the stage was set for the coming of a new and strong religious leader for the Jewish people, the long-awaited Messiah.",

    "content": "Herod the Great\nHerod the Great was the Roman-appointed king of Judea (37–4 BC) at the time of Jesus’ birth (Matt 2:1; Luke 1:5). He was a strong military leader, a brilliant politician, and a cruel tyrant. Born into an Idumean (Edomite) family with links to the Romans, he rose to power by gaining Roman favor and retained it by cruelly suppressing his opponents.\nHerod was known for his large building projects. His greatest accomplishment was the rebuilding and beautification of the Jerusalem Temple, begun ~20 BC (Josephus, Antiquities 15.8.1), making it one of the most magnificent buildings in the ancient world. He also built Caesarea and made it the Roman headquarters in Palestine. Herod earned the title “the Great” because of his reputation as a great builder.\nHerod was also known for his family troubles and his brutal treatment of those who opposed him or whom he considered threats. He murdered two of his wives and three of his own sons when he suspected them of plotting against him. Caesar Augustus once said that he would rather be Herod’s swine than his son (a play on words in Greek since the two words sound alike—hus, huios). When Jesus was born toward the end of Herod’s reign and Herod heard him referred to as a future “king,” Herod attempted to have him killed also. Unable to locate the boy, Herod ordered the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in the Bethlehem area (see Matt 2:1-20)—an act typical of his ruthlessness and paranoia.\nThough Herod gained the title “king of the Jews,” the Jewish people never accepted him as a legitimate king because he was not from the line of David and because he was an Edomite (a descendant of Esau) rather than a Jew.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 2:1-20; Luke 1:5",

    "content": "The Pharisees\nThe Pharisees were one of three major Jewish sects, along with the Sadducees and the Essenes. The Pharisees comprised a non-political lay movement within Judaism. They arose from the hasidim (pious ones), who opposed the syncretizing (combining together) of Greek culture and religion with Judaism in the second century BC.\nThe Pharisees attempted, by rigorous examination of the details of the Old Testament law, to make the law accessible and practical to people seeking to be obedient Jews. They taught strict adherence to the law, not only the written law of Moses (torah), but also the oral traditions which they claimed Moses had passed down to them. Their goal was to defend the written law against any possible infringement. They were God-fearing and law-abiding people. They were known for passing their interpretations from generation to generation by word of mouth, establishing an oral tradition concerning legal matters. They made the law applicable by extracting from it specific guidelines for many possible situations. They argued that if the law were obeyed by all, the nation would be purged of sin and God would establish his Kingdom over all the nations. This gave their concern for obedience a goal in the future. The traditions of the Pharisees developed into the rabbinic writings known as the Mishnah and the Talmud.\nAlthough the Pharisees were small in number, their influence on Israel was widespread (see Matt 15:12-14; see also Josephus, War 2.8.14; Antiquities 13.10.5). The primary influence of the Pharisees was in the local synagogue communities, while the Sadducees were more influential in the worship at the Temple in Jerusalem and in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high council.\nUnlike the Sadducees, the Pharisees had a strong belief in the resurrection of the dead (see Acts 23:6-8). After the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, the Pharisees provided leadership and direction for the people of Israel.\nJesus often came into conflict with the Pharisees, accusing them of hypocrisy and of elevating human rules over God’s righteous standards. Jesus opposed the Pharisees because they were leading people away from God’s plan for redemption. They were the theological shepherds of Israel, but Jesus castigated them as hypocrites for their perversions of doctrine and practice (see Matt 23). And the Pharisees were antagonistic toward Jesus, rejecting both him and his work, largely because of his shocking disregard of their traditions (see e.g., Matt 15:1-20).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 3:7; 5:20; 9:10-14, 34; 12:1-14, 22-24, 38-40; 15:1-14; 16:1-12; 19:3; 21:45; 22:15, 34; 23:1-7, 13-31; 27:62-64; Mark 2:23-25; 3:1-6; 7:1-13; 8:11-12; 12:13-17; Luke 5:17-21, 29-32; 6:6-11; 7:28-30, 36-49; 11:37-54; 12:1-3; 13:31; 14:1-6; 15:1-2; 16:13-15; 17:20-21; 18:9-14; 19:38-40; John 1:24-25; 3:1; 7:31-32, 45-52; 8:3-10, 13; 9:13-34, 40; 11:46-57; 12:17-19, 42; 18:3; Acts 5:27-40; 15:5; 23:6-10; 26:4-5; Phil 3:5-7",

    "content": "Matthew (Levi)\nMatthew was a tax collector for the Romans and became one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. According to early tradition, he was the author of the Gospel of Matthew.\nThough he is called Matthew in all the lists of the apostles (Matt 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13), he is referred to as Levi—his other name—in two of the accounts of his calling (Mark 2:14-15; Luke 5:27-29; cp. Matt 9:9-10). His father was named Alphaeus (Mark 2:14), but there is no certainty that he is the brother of James the son of Alphaeus (the two are not linked in the lists of the apostles, as the other pairs of brothers are).\nJews who collected taxes for the Romans were generally considered despicable sinners by their fellow Jews. They profited from working for the occupying forces and engaged in legalized extortion. Thus it is significant that Jesus called a tax collector to become one of his followers. When Jesus was criticized by the Pharisees for accepting Matthew’s invitation to his home for dinner, and for eating with tax collectors and other disreputable sinners, Jesus used the occasion to teach the importance of compassion. He emphasized that it was precisely for such sinners—not those who considered themselves righteous—that he had come (Matt 9:9-13; Mark 2:14-17; Luke 5:27-32). Matthew responded immediately to Jesus’ call, leaving everything behind to follow Jesus (Luke 5:28). The implication is that he never turned back to tax collecting or his former way of life.\nMatthew’s Gospel, written for his fellow Jews, gives us a Jewish perspective on the life and teachings of Jesus, and it includes topics of special interest for those from a Jewish background. His Gospel was the most popular Gospel in the early church, which is probably why it occurs first in the canonical sequence.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 9:9-10; 10:3; Mark 2:14-15; 3:18; Luke 5:27-29; 6:15; Acts 1:13",

    "content": "Simon Peter\nSimon Peter was the most prominent of the twelve apostles. After Jesus’ death, he became the primary spokesman for the early Christians in Jerusalem and was the apostle primarily responsible for evangelizing the Jews (Gal 2:7-8).\nThe Hebrew name Simeon (transliterated in English as “Simon”) was probably his original name. Cephas is the transliteration of an Aramaic name given him by Jesus, meaning “rock”—translated in Greek as Petros (English “Peter”; see Matt 16:17-18; John 1:42).\nThough Bethsaida was Peter’s hometown (John 1:44), he later lived in Capernaum. He was married (1 Cor 9:5), and at one point, when visiting Peter’s home, Jesus healed Peter’s mother-in-law (Matt 8:14-15; Mark 1:29-31; Luke 4:38-39).\nOriginally fishermen, Peter and his brother Andrew were among the first to be called by Jesus to be disciples, together with James and John, their fishing partners (Matt 4:18-22; Mark 1:16-20; cp. Luke 5:1-11; John 1:35-51). They were ordinary, minimally educated working men (Acts 4:13).\nPeter’s name occurs first on every list of the twelve apostles (Matt 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14; Acts 1:13). Together with the brothers James and John, Peter was part of an “inner circle” of disciples who were with Jesus on certain special occasions—the healing of Jairus’s daughter (Mark 5:37; Luke 8:51), Jesus’ transfiguration (Matt 17:1-2; Mark 9:2; Luke 9:28-29), and Jesus’ prayer in the garden (Matt 26:37; Mark 14:33).\nPeter was bold and impulsive (Matt 26:33; Mark 14:29; Luke 5:8; 22:33; John 13:36-37; 21:7), and the first of the disciples to confess his belief in Jesus as the Messiah (Matt 16:15-16; Mark 8:29; Luke 9:20). He reproved Jesus when Jesus spoke of his coming death—a notion that did not fit Peter’s view of the Messiah—and was in turn rebuked by Jesus for it (Matt 16:21-23; Mark 8:31-33). However, Jesus spoke of Peter as a key person he would use to build the church (Matt 16:18-19).\nPeter surreptitiously entered the courtyard of the high priest when Jesus was taken there for interrogation. But when challenged by people who recognized him (partly because of his Galilean accent), he vigorously denied all knowledge of Jesus (26:69-75; Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:54-62)—as Jesus had said he would, in spite of Peter’s insistence that he would never do so (Matt 26:33-35; Mark 14:29-31; Luke 22:31-34). Peter immediately felt deep remorse.\nAfter the news of Jesus’ resurrection, Peter was one of the first to run to the tomb to see if it was true (John 20:3-7), and he appears to have been the first of the Twelve to whom the risen Jesus showed himself (Luke 24:33-34; 1 Cor 15:5). Much of Jesus’ conversation recorded in John 21 was with Peter, whom Jesus encouraged to “feed my sheep” (John 21:15-17).\nFollowing the coming of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-13), Peter quickly emerged as the primary spokesman for the early Christians. From that point on, as recorded in Acts 2:14–12:25, he played a crucial role in the spread of the gospel in Judea, boldly preaching to the crowds (Acts 2:14-41; 3:12-26), healing people (Acts 3:1-11; 5:12-16; 9:32-43), and—even under arrest—speaking fearlessly to the authorities (Acts 4:1-20; 5:26-32). Twice he miraculously escaped from prison (Acts 5:18-25; 12:6-11). He also exercised leadership in the administrative affairs of the quickly growing community of disciples (Acts 5:3-11).\nPeter was the first to bring the Good News to Gentiles (Acts 10:1-48; see Matt 16:18). And he played a key role in the Jerusalem council concerning Gentile converts, arguing that Gentiles should not be compelled to observe the law of Moses but should be accepted on the basis of their faith in Christ alone (Acts 15:7-11). Later, however, when visiting Antioch, he was inconsistent on this point—resulting in a rebuke from Paul (Gal 2:11-16).\nOther than his taking his wife with him on at least some of his mission trips (1 Cor 9:5), few details are known about Peter’s later life and missionary work. (He may have spent time at Corinth; see 1 Cor 1:12; 3:22). Widespread early tradition says that Peter was crucified—like his Lord, just as Jesus had predicted (John 21:18-19)—in Rome during Nero’s persecution of Christians in AD 64–65. The reliability of the tradition that he was crucified upside-down is less certain.\nPeter was likely the source of the material recorded by Mark in his Gospel, which Mark probably learned while he was assisting Peter in his evangelistic work in Italy near the end of his life. Peter is also traditionally understood to be the author of 1 Peter (written from Rome—“Babylon,” 1 Pet 5:13) and 2 Peter.\nIn the New Testament, Peter stands as a reassuring example of Christ’s forgiving grace for those who know they’ve failed him—and of the way Christ can graciously restore and use such people for his glory, in spite of their failings.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 4:18-20; 8:14; 10:2; 14:28-31; 15:15; 16:16-19, 22-23; 17:1-4, 24-27; 18:21; 19:27; 26:33-45, 58, 69-75; Mark 1:16-18, 29-30, 36-37; 3:16; 5:37; 8:29-33; 9:2-6; 10:28; 11:21; 13:3-4; 14:29-42, 54, 66-72; 16:7-8; Luke 4:38; 5:3-10; 6:14; 8:45, 51; 9:20, 28-33; 12:41; 18:28; 22:8, 31-34, 55-62; 24:12, 34; John 1:40-42, 44; 6:8, 68; 13:6-10, 24, 36-38; 18:10-11, 15-18, 25-27; 20:2-6; 21:2-21; Acts 1:1–12:25; 15:7-11; Gal 2:7-16; 1 Pet 1:1–5:14; 2 Pet 1:1–3:18",

The Sadducees probably lived in the vicinity of Jerusalem and controlled the Temple system (Acts 4:1-2; 5:17). They were powerful aristocrats and mediators between Rome and Israel (see Josephus, Antiquities 13.10.6; War 2.10.5). They did not have great favor or influence with the people (Josephus, Antiquities 18.1.4). The term Sadducee probably derives from Zadok, the high priest during the reigns of David (2 Sam 8:17; 15:24; 1 Kgs 1:8) and Solomon (1 Kgs 1:32-48); both words have the same Hebrew root. The earliest historical reference to the Sadducees occurs during the reign of John Hyrcanus (135–104 BC), a descendant of the Maccabees (Josephus, Antiquities 13.10.6), but it is clear from this account that they had already existed for some time.\nTheir theological views are often contrasted with those of the Pharisees (Acts 23:8; see also Acts 4:1-2). The Pentateuch had primary authority for the Sadducees. They rejected the oral tradition so cherished by the Pharisees. Also in contrast with the Pharisees, the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection of the dead (see Matt 22:23-33), angelic beings (see Acts 23:8), or the concept of final judgment. The Pharisees, by contrast, were so committed to belief in the resurrection that they sided with Paul against the Sadducees when he was on trial for disturbing the Temple (Acts 23:6-10).\nDespite their differences, the Pharisees and Sadducees united with a single front against Jesus. If the Pharisees opposed Jesus because he made light of their oral traditions, the Sadducees opposed Jesus because he affirmed the supernatural world of angels and demons and appealed to a final judgment and resurrection.\nWith the destruction of the Temple in AD 70, the Sadducees disappeared from the scene. They left no written records. Since all our information about the Sadducees comes from their opponents, we have a limited idea of what they were really like.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 3:7; 16:1-12; 22:23-33; Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40; Acts 4:1-2; 5:17-18; 23:6-10",

    "content": "The Jewish High Council\nThe high council of Jewish aristocrats in Jerusalem was endowed with considerable power in governing the Jewish people. It is traditionally called the Sanhedrin, a transliteration of the Greek word sunedrion (“council”).\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the Sanhedrin dates from Moses’ choice of seventy elders (Num 11:16), but the earliest datable reference is found in Josephus (Antiquities 12.3.3) from the time of Antiochus the Great (223–187 BC). The Sanhedrin probably emerged from a self-governing body of leaders under the Persians (see Ezra 5:5-10; Neh 2:16). The high council was controlled by the priestly class under the leadership of the high priest, though these priests were influenced to various degrees by Roman rulers and the Pharisees. Herod the Great exercised a particularly heavy hand over the affairs of the Sanhedrin.\nThe Sanhedrin managed the internal legal and religious affairs of Judaism, including judicial decisions not resolved in lesser courts (called “local sanhedrins”), criminal justice and arrests (see Acts 9:1-2), and official (though unenforceable) decisions regarding Jewish matters. Though the Sanhedrin could not of its own accord put tried criminals to death (John 18:31), apparently it could do so with the support of Roman officials.\nThe destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 eliminated the high council as the ruling body of Judaism.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 26:57-68; Mark 14:53-65; 15:1, 43; Luke 22:66-71; 23:50-54; John 11:47-53; Acts 5:21-41; 6:11–8:1; 22:30–23:10; 23:26-30",

    "content": "Women Named Mary\nFour other Marys, apart from the mother of Jesus, are mentioned in the Gospels:\n(1) Mary Magdalene (probably from Magdala in Galilee) was freed from demon possession by Jesus (Mark 16:9) and became a faithful follower and financial supporter of Jesus and his disciples (Luke 8:1-3; see also Matt 27:55-56; Mark 15:40-41). She was present when Jesus was crucified and buried (Matt 27:55-61; Mark 15:40-47; John 19:25; cp. Luke 23:49, 55-56), and she went to the tomb early on Sunday morning with burial spices. She was among the first to be told of his resurrection (Matt 28:1-8; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-11, 22-24), and she was the first to see the resurrected Jesus (Matt 28:9-10; Mark 16:9-11; John 20:1-2, 11-18).\n(2) Mary the mother of James the younger (not the same person as James the apostle) and Joseph was also among the women who were present when Jesus was crucified and buried (Matt 27:55-61; Mark 15:40-47; cp. Luke 23:49, 55). Like Mary Magdalene, she was among the first who heard the news of his resurrection (Matt 28:1-8; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-11), and she was one of the first to see the risen Jesus (Matt 28:9-10).\n(3) Mary of Bethany was the sister of Martha and Lazarus; their family was much loved by Jesus (John 11:5). Jesus commended Mary for her eagerness to learn from him (Luke 10:38-42). Soon after Jesus had raised her brother from the dead (John 11:32-45), Mary anointed Jesus’ feet with very expensive perfume, an act defended by Jesus when others criticized it as extravagant (John 12:1-11; cp. Matt 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9).\n(4) Mary the wife of Clopas was also among the women watching when Jesus was crucified (John 19:25). Her husband, Clopas, is not mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 27:55-61; 28:1; Mark 15:40-47; 16:1-11; Luke 8:2-3; 10:38-42; 24:1-10; John 11:1-6, 17-24; 12:3-8; 19:25; 20:1-2, 11-18; Acts 12:12",

    "content": "Herod Antipas\nHerod Antipas, sixth son of Herod the Great, was ruler of Galilee and Perea from 4 BC to AD 39, during the life of Jesus. His jurisdiction included the regions where Jesus and John the Baptist concentrated their ministries.\nFollowing the example of his father, Herod Antipas founded cities. Sepphoris, his first project, was the largest city in Galilee. It was Antipas’s capital city until he built Tiberias, named in honor of the reigning emperor, Tiberius (AD 14–37). The city Tiberias was on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Antipas completed the city in AD 23 and made it his capital.\nHerod Antipas offended many Jews by divorcing his wife and marrying Herodias, the wife of his half brother, Herod Philip. Antipas’s marriage to Herodias was in violation of the law of Moses (Lev 18:16; 20:21) because Herod’s brother Philip was still alive. When John the Baptist spoke out strongly against this illegal marriage, Antipas imprisoned him (Mark 6:17-18); Herod was afraid John’s denunciation would lead to a political revolt (Josephus, Antiquities 18.5.2). Later, at a banquet, Herodias’s daughter pleased Herod with her dancing, evoking a rash promise from him to give her anything she wanted. Herodias took the opportunity to have John beheaded (Matt 14:1-12).\nIt was obvious to Antipas that Jesus’ ministry was even more remarkable than John’s (see Mark 6:14-16; Matt 14:1-2; Luke 9:7-9), but he was reluctant to use force to bring about a meeting, for fear of arousing the people against him. Jesus, for his part, was openly critical of Herod Antipas (Mark 8:15; Luke 13:31-33).\nWhen Jesus was finally arrested, Pilate could find no fault in Jesus, so he sent him to Herod Antipas, who was in Jerusalem for Passover. Pilate may also have been attempting to reconcile himself to Antipas. Their relationship had been rather strained since the Galilean massacre (Luke 13:1), and because Pilate had brought votive shields to Jerusalem that bore the image of Tiberius and were considered blasphemous by the Jews (Philo, On the Embassy to Gaius 299–304). When Jesus was brought before Antipas, Herod only mocked him and sent him back to Pilate (Luke 23:6-11). The main political accomplishment of the incident was that Herod and Pilate were indeed reconciled (Luke 23:12).\nHerod Antipas was later defeated in war by King Aretas, whose daughter he had divorced. (Jews interpreted this defeat as an act of divine judgment.) He was then deposed by Emperor Gaius in AD 39 and sent into exile, in response to accusations from Herod Agrippa I of Antipas’s conspiracy against Rome.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 14:1-12; Mark 1:14; 6:14-29; Luke 3:1, 19-20; 9:7-9; 13:31-33; 23:7-12, 15; Acts 4:27",

    "content": "Judas Iscariot\nJudas Iscariot is infamous for betraying Jesus to the authorities (Matt 10:4; Mark 3:19; Luke 6:16).\nThe meaning of the name “Iscariot” is uncertain; it might refer to a village named Kerioth. He is not the same person as Judas son of James (Luke 6:16; John 14:22).\nAmong the apostles, Judas Iscariot came to be known as greedy; he carried the money bag and had the reputation of stealing from it (John 12:4-6). The money offered him as a bribe by the leading priests later convinced him to betray Jesus (Matt 26:14-16; Mark 14:10-11; Luke 22:3-6).\nJesus called Judas himself a devil (John 6:70-71) and predicted the betrayal (Mark 14:18-21). The devil put the idea of betrayal into Judas’s mind, and Satan “entered” him at the time of the betrayal (Luke 22:3-4; John 13:2, 27). Judas led a group of soldiers and officers to the garden of Gethsemane in the middle of the night, where he found Jesus and betrayed him with a prearranged signal, a kiss of greeting (Mark 14:43-46). Later, Judas was apparently overcome by remorse for betraying an innocent man, and he hanged himself (Matt 27:3-10; Acts 1:18-19).\nJesus clearly understood Judas’s betrayal as part of God’s plan for redemption: It brought about the death of the Messiah as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (Matt 26:24, 53-54; Mark 14:21; Luke 22:22; John 17:12). Even though Judas served God’s plan, his tragic end was clearly deserved (Acts 1:24-25). It would have been better for Judas if he had never been born (Matt 26:24; Mark 14:21). Judas’s fate soberly warns those who are apparently followers of Jesus but have never committed themselves to him personally (cp.

    "content": "Pontius Pilate\nPontius Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea from AD 26 to 36, including the time of Jesus’ death in AD 30 or 33. Pilate gave the official order for Jesus to be crucified.\nAs the governor of Judea, Pilate was in control of all the Roman occupation forces as well as the Temple and its funds. He was the only one who had the authority to execute criminals (see John 18:31), so the Jewish authorities were compelled to bring charges before Pilate in order to have Jesus executed (Mark 15:1-4).\nPilate was sometimes abusive as governor. He appropriated Temple funds to construct a thirty-five-mile aqueduct for Jerusalem, provoking a major protest. In response, Pilate had soldiers infiltrate the crowds in disguise and beat the offenders to death with clubs (Josephus, War 2.9.4; Antiquities 18.3.2). Another time, Pilate murdered some Galileans “as they were offering sacrifices at the Temple” (Luke 13:1); this incident might have estranged him from the Galilean ruler Herod Antipas. Pilate also tried to bring images of Caesar into Jerusalem for worship. Later (AD 36), Pilate slaughtered pilgrims who followed a Samaritan false prophet, an event that led to his dismissal by the emperor Tiberius in the same year.\nEach Gospel records Pilate’s role in the death of Jesus (Matt 27:11-26; Mark 15:1:1-15; Luke 23:1-25; John 18:28–19:16; see also Acts 3:13; 4:27; 13:28; 1 Tim 6:13). After interrogating Jesus, he was convinced that Jesus had done nothing deserving of death, so he tried to return the case to the Jewish authorities. When they resisted, he tried to pass Jesus to Herod Antipas for judgment—but he, too, refused the case. Pilate finally tried appealing to a traditional Roman custom of freeing a prisoner on Passover. Meanwhile, his wife had been deeply troubled by a dream about “that innocent man” (Matt 27:19). But the clamor of the crowd became threatening, and the Jewish leaders began insinuating that Pilate was not taking Jesus’ threat to Rome seriously. Pilate yielded to Jewish pressure. He ordered that Jesus be whipped and then crucified, with the title “King of the Jews” posted on a sign over his head—but only after strenuously objecting and declaring himself to be innocent of the guilt of such an unjust death (Matt 27:18-25; Mark 15:14; Luke 23:4, 13-23; John 18:38); 19:4-16. Pilate’s attitude toward Jesus stands as a testimony that Jesus posed no threat to the Roman government but only to the Jewish leadership. This may have been a helpful point for later Christians who were portrayed as a threat to Rome.\nShortly after Jesus’ death, Pilate gave special permission to Joseph of Arimathea to take the body of Jesus from the cross and bury it (Matt 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-46; Luke 23:50-53; John 19:38-42). He also gave permission to the Jewish authorities to seal the tomb to make sure no one would steal the body or make false claims about Jesus coming back to life (Matt 27:62-66).\nLittle is known of Pilate after his dismissal in AD 36; Eusebius reports that Pilate committed suicide during the reign of Caligula, AD 37–41 (Eusebius, Church History 2.7).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 27:2, 11-26, 57-58, 62-65; Mark 15:1-15, 43-45; Luke 3:1; 13:1; 23:1-25, 52; 18:28–19:16; 19:31, 38; Acts 3:13; 4:27; 13:28; 1 Tim 6:13",

    "content": "Mary, Mother of Jesus\nMary, the wife of Joseph, was the virgin mother of Jesus. Luke tells us that as a young girl in Nazareth, Mary was betrothed to Joseph, a local carpenter. Before the marriage took place, an angel announced to her that she would become pregnant by the power of God’s Spirit and give birth to the Son of God (Luke 1:26-35). Mary responded to this extraordinary message in simple faith, humbly submitting herself to God’s will (Luke 1:38; see also Luke 1:46-55). Shortly thereafter, the message was confirmed by her relative Elizabeth, who spoke of Mary as the most blessed of all women (Luke 1:39-45). Mary’s miraculous bearing of the Son of God was viewed as a fulfillment of prophecy (Isa 7:14).\nJesus’ birth took place in unusual circumstances, when Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem to register for an official Roman census. The child was born in a stable because no other lodging was available (Luke 2:1-7). Some time later, Mary and Joseph fled to Egypt to save the child from Herod’s massacre of young boys in the Bethlehem area (Matt 2:13-18). When they returned, they resettled in Nazareth to raise their family (Matt 2:19-23). After Jesus’ birth, Mary apparently gave birth to several other sons and daughters (Matt 13:55-56; Mark 6:3). It is likely that Mary herself told Luke the details of Jesus’ birth and the unusual events associated with it (see Luke 2:51).\nWhen Jesus was twelve years old, he stayed in the Temple during a family trip to Jerusalem. Mary and Joseph rebuked him for staying behind when they departed, but they did not understand Jesus’ response (Luke 2:41-51). Early in Jesus’ public ministry, Mary encouraged him to do a miracle at a wedding in Cana (John 2:1-11). Later, when she and Jesus’ brothers went to see Jesus, he said that his disciples were his “real family” (Matt 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21).\nWhen Jesus was crucified, Mary was among the women looking on (cp. Mark 15:40, 47; John 19:25). As Jesus was dying, he asked John, the “disciple he loved,” to take care of Mary as his own mother (John 19:26-27). After Jesus’ death and resurrection, Mary was apparently a member of the believing community; she is listed among those who were praying together when the Spirit came on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 1:14).\nGod chose Mary to bring his Son, the Savior, into the world. For all Christians, she is a model of humble and obedient submission to God’s will.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 1:16, 18-25; 2:11, 13-23; Luke 1:26–2:51; John 19:25-27; Acts 1:14",

    "content": "James, Son of Zebedee\nJames, son of Zebedee and brother of John, was one of the twelve apostles, and he was among the first to be killed as a follower of Jesus. His mother was possibly the sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus, which would make him Jesus’ cousin (cp. Matt 27:56; Mark 15:40; 16:1; John 19:25). His name usually occurs before that of John, which may suggest that James was the older of the two. He should not be confused with James, son of Alphaeus (see Luke 6:15) or James, brother of Jesus.\nJames and John were fishermen like their father (Matt 4:21; Mark 1:19); they fished with Peter and Andrew, another pair of brothers who became disciples (Luke 5:10). They were among the first that Jesus called to be his disciples, and they left everything, including their father, to follow him (Matt 4:22; Mark 1:20; Luke 5:11). Jesus called them “Sons of Thunder” (Mark 3:17), which might imply that they had vehement personalities (see Luke 9:54), though the exact connotation is unclear.\nJames and his brother John were among those closest to Jesus. With Peter, they formed an inner circle of trusted disciples who accompanied Jesus on special occasions, as when he healed Jairus’s daughter (Mark 5:37; Luke 8:51), conversed with Elijah and Moses on a mountain (Matt 17:1-3; Mark 9:2-4; Luke 9:28-30), and agonized in prayer in the garden (Matt 26:37; Mark 14:33). At one point, the two brothers provoked the indignation of the other disciples by asking for special positions of privilege in the coming Kingdom (Matt 20:20-28; Mark 10:35-45; cp. Luke 22:24-27).\nPerhaps because of James’s prominence among the disciples, Herod Agrippa had him killed soon after Jesus’ death, which pleased the Jewish leaders (Acts 12:1-3) and fulfilled Jesus’ prediction about his drinking the bitter cup that Jesus drank (Matt 20:23; Mark 10:38-39).\nJames was an ordinary working person whom Jesus called to be his disciple. His willingness to leave everything he knew—work, family, and home—to follow Jesus in simple trust, and eventually to die for him, makes him a model of committed discipleship.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 4:21-22; 10:2; 17:1; 20:20-24; 26:37-46; Mark 1:19-20, 29; 3:17; 5:37; 9:2; 10:35-41; 13:3-4; 14:33-42; Luke 5:10; 6:14; 8:51; 9:28, 54-55; John 21:2; Acts 1:13; 12:2",

    "content": "Martha, Mary, and Lazarus\nThe sisters Martha and Mary lived with their brother Lazarus in Bethany, near Jerusalem; Jesus loved and spent time with this family. Martha and Mary are mentioned only in the Gospels of Luke and John, while Lazarus appears only in John (this Lazarus is not Lazarus the beggar from Luke 16:19-31).\nLuke’s account of these two sisters (10:38-42) focuses on the contrast between Martha and Mary. When Jesus visited their home, Martha was busy in the kitchen and became upset with her sister for not helping her prepare the meal. Jesus defended Mary’s desire to simply sit and learn from him as the most important thing.\nJohn’s Gospel relays Jesus’ act of raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-44). When Jesus arrived in Bethany, four days after Lazarus had died, the sisters expressed their dismay that Jesus had not come in time to heal their sick brother, and Jesus was deeply moved by the weeping of Lazarus’s family and friends. He went to the tomb and ordered Lazarus to come out. To everyone’s astonishment, he did so, bound in the cloths he had been buried in. This amazing miracle exemplifies Jesus as the giver of eternal life (John 11:25-26). Ironically, this act of restoring Lazarus’s life also galvanized the Jewish leaders to bring about Jesus’ death because so many people were responding to Jesus’ miracles (John 11:47-53; 12:10-11).\nSoon thereafter, when the family invited Jesus to their home for a celebration meal, Mary poured a bottle of extremely expensive perfume on Jesus. When people criticized her for what they considered an extravagant waste, Jesus defended her action, saying that it anticipated his coming death (John 12:1-8; cp. Matt 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; Luke 10:38-42; John 11:1-44; 12:1-11, 17",

    "content": "John the Baptist\nJohn the Baptist was a fiery open-air preacher who called people to repent and be baptized. John worked in the role of Elijah, to prepare people for the coming of the Messiah (Mal 4:4-5; Matt 11:14; 17:12; Mark 9:13).\nJohn’s birth, like that of Jesus, was miraculous. His parents were elderly and had been unable to have children (Luke 1:5-25). His mother, Elizabeth, was a relative of Mary, Jesus’ mother (Luke 1:36), so John was related to Jesus. The two miraculous births around the same time signaled the beginning of God’s redeeming work.\nJohn was filled with the Holy Spirit from birth and devoted his life to preparing people for the coming of the Lord (Luke 1:15-17). Living in the desert (Luke 1:80), he began preaching when he was about thirty years old. Dressed like a prophet and subsisting on desert food (locusts and wild honey, see Matt 3:4; Mark 1:6), he called everyone to repent and be baptized (Matt 3:1-2; Mark 1:4; Luke 3:1-3). He even castigated the religious leaders who came to hear him (Matt 3:7-10).\nThough John reluctantly baptized Jesus (Matt 3:13-17), he considered Jesus his superior, the one who would “baptize with the Holy Spirit” (John 1:33; Matt 3:11; Mark 1:7-8; Luke 3:16; cp. John 3:23-30). He encouraged his followers to become Jesus’ disciples—and many did, including Andrew (1:35-40), Apollos (Acts 18:24-26), and the twelve disciples at Ephesus (Acts 19:1-7).\nHerod Antipas received harsh judgment from John because of Herod’s unlawful marriage to Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. To please Herodias, Herod imprisoned John and then beheaded him (Matt 14:3-12; Mark 6:17-29; Luke 3:19-20). John’s imprisonment marked the beginning of Jesus’ public preaching (Matt 4:12; Mark 1:14).\nShortly before his death, John seemed to be confused about Jesus and sent messengers from prison to ask him if he really was the Messiah. Jesus did not do what most people anticipated the Messiah would do. Rather than bringing judgment and a visible kingdom, he brought forgiveness, healing, and a spiritual kingdom. To reassure John, Jesus spoke of the miraculous things God was doing through him (Luke 7:18-23).\nJohn remained faithful to his calling throughout his life, consistently preaching repentance and the judgment of God, even to people who had no desire to hear it. Jesus referred to John as one of the greatest servants of God who had ever lived (Matt 11:2-19; Luke 7:18-35), the end of a long line of prophets anticipating the coming of the Kingdom of God (Luke 16:16). John stood on the threshold of the new age, proclaiming its coming to all who would hear.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatthew 3:1-15; 4:12; 9:14; 11:2-19; 14:1-12; 16:14; 17:10-13; 21:24-27, 31-32; Mark 1:1-9, 14; 2:18; 6:14-29; 8:28; 9:11-13; 11:29-33; Luke 1:13-17, 36, 39-43, 57-66, 76-80; 3:1-21; 5:33; 7:18-35; 9:7-9, 19; 11:1; 16:16; 20:3-8; John 1:6-37; John 3:23-36; 4:1-3; 10:40-42; Acts 1:5; 10:37; 11:16; 18:25-26; 19:1-7",

He is mentioned only in the Gospel of John.\nIntrigued by the authority of Jesus and the miracles he was doing, Nicodemus went to see him secretly, at night, in an attempt to discover who he really was.

The Gospel does not give us Nicodemus’s response.\nLater, however, in opposition to his colleagues on the Jewish high council, he strongly argued that Jesus should be given a fair trial (John 7:50-51). After Jesus was crucified, he bought seventy-five pounds of expensive perfumed ointment for his burial, took it to the tomb, and assisted Joseph of Arimathea in burying him (John 19:39-42). Thus, Nicodemus appears to be an example of a Pharisee who came to believe in Jesus and was willing to express that commitment publicly after his death.\nPassages for Further Study\nJohn 3:1-9; 7:50; 19:39-42",

    "content": "Samaritans\nSamaria was a geographic region north of Judea centered around the ancient city of Shechem (Sychar in the New Testament was located at or near the site of Shechem). After Israel was conquered in 722 BC and the cities of Samaria and Shechem were destroyed, this region was repopulated with people from throughout the Assyrian empire (2 Kgs 17:21-41). These inhabitants introduced countless pagan practices, making the religious impurity of the land infamous. In time, the monotheism of Judaism prevailed, but with significant modifications: The Samaritan scriptures were limited to the Pentateuch, and their worship was centered on a new temple on Mount Gerizim above Shechem.\nThe Samaritans also had a long history of conflict with the Jews, beginning after the Jews’ return from exile (see Ezra 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-23). Alexander the Great and later Greek generals made Shechem an important base, knowing that they could find sympathetic, anti-Jewish allies there. The Jews destroyed Shechem in 128 BC and burned the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim. The Samaritans returned the favor in AD 6–9 when they desecrated the Jerusalem Temple by scattering human bones from a cemetery during one Passover. By Jesus’ day, smoldering tension existed between Judea and Samaria.\nJews in the time of Jesus therefore avoided traveling through this land whose people they perceived as hostile and impure. When Jesus traveled through Samaria and met a Samaritan woman, all of the fraught tensions of this relationship are in view. A first-century reader would barely expect Jesus and the woman to acknowledge each other, much less speak. Yet Jesus reached beyond his ethnic identity to call even a Samaritan woman of ill-repute to believe.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 17:21-41; Ezra 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-23; John 4:1-42",

    "content": "Jewish Leaders\nJesus experienced numerous conflicts with Jewish leaders throughout his public ministry. These opponents viewed themselves as defending the Temple and its sacrifices or the synagogue and its teachings. In Jesus’ final week in Jerusalem, these debates intensified (see Matt 23) and contributed to the case against him.\nWhen John wrote his Gospel, Christians were being persecuted by local Jewish synagogues, and the language of those conflicts spilled over into John’s Gospel (see Acts 14:19; 1 Thes 2:14; cp. Gal 1:13-14). The Greek term translated “Jewish leaders” could be literally translated as “Jews.” But the word took on this technical meaning to refer to the Temple leadership who confronted Jesus, judged him, and orchestrated his crucifixion (see John 1:19; 2:18; 5:9-18; 9:18-22). This is important because the New Testament—particularly John’s Gospel—has often been seen as anti-Semitic. But the truth is that Jesus, who was himself a Jew, did not wrestle with “Jews” in general. His antagonists were the “Jewish leaders”—the brokers of religious power in first-century Jerusalem.\nPassages for Further Study\nJohn 1:19-24; 2:18-20; 5:9-18; 7:1, 10-13, 35-36; 9:13-34; 11:45-54; 12:41-43; 18:28-36; 19:6-8, 12-16, 31, 38; 20:19; Acts 6:10-12; 7:54-58; 12:11; 21:11; 25:1-3, 7; 26:1-11; 28:17-24; 2 Corinthians 11:24",

    "content": "John, Son of Zebedee\nJohn, brother of James and son of Zebedee, was one of the twelve apostles. Early tradition identifies him as the author of the Gospel of John, the Letters of John, and the book of Revelation.\nJohn and his brother James were among those closest to Jesus (Mark 5:37; 9:2; 13:3; 14:33). His mother, Salome, might have been a sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus (cp. Matt 27:56; Mark 15:40; 16:1; John 19:25). John’s name usually occurs after James’s, which suggests that John was younger. James and John were fishermen like their father (Matt 4:21; Mark 1:19). They fished with Peter and Andrew, another pair of brothers who became disciples (Luke 5:8-10). They were among the first whom Jesus called as disciples, and they left everything to follow him (Matt 4:22; Mark 1:20; Luke 5:11; cp. John 1:35-40). Jesus named them “Sons of Thunder” (Mark 3:17), which might imply that they were loud or short-tempered (see Luke 9:54). At one point, the two brothers evoked the indignation of the other disciples when they asked for special positions of privilege in the coming kingdom (Matt 20:20-28; Mark 10:35-45; cp. Luke 22:24-27).\nJohn is understood to be the unnamed “disciple Jesus loved” and “another disciple” mentioned in the Gospel of John (John 13:23-25; 18:15-16; 19:26-27; 20:2-10; 21:20-24). He may have been the unnamed disciple of John the Baptist, who, together with Andrew, became an early follower of Jesus (John 1:35-40).\nJohn’s name occurs three times in Acts; each time he was working with Peter (Acts 3:1-11; 4:1-23; 8:14-25). Paul referred to him as one of the “pillars” of the church in Jerusalem (Gal 2:9).\nThe most widespread tradition about John’s later life is that he moved to Ephesus, where he eventually became the bishop of Asia Minor, lived to an old age, and died peacefully in the company of friends. His Gospel provides a profound portrait of Jesus, and his letters provide a moving depiction of the Christian life (1–3 John).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 4:21-22; 10:2; 17:1; 20:20-24; 26:37-46; Mark 1:19-20, 29; 3:17; 5:37; 9:2, 38; 10:35-41; 13:3-4; 14:33-42; Luke 5:10; 6:14; 8:51; 9:28, 49, 54; John 13:23-25; 18:15-16; 19:26-27; 20:2-10; 21:2, 7, 20-24; Acts 1:13; 3:1-11; 4:1-22; 5:17-42; 8:14-25; Gal 2:9",

    "content": "Annas and Caiaphas\nAnnas and Caiaphas were both spoken of as high priests during the time of Jesus, and they were instrumental in getting Jesus condemned to death.\nAnnas was the Jewish high priest around AD 6–15. But even after he was officially deposed by the Roman procurator of Judea, he retained considerable power and influence in the Jewish high council and was still spoken of as “high priest” fifteen to twenty years later (Luke 3:2; Acts 4:6)—perhaps because of the Jewish view that high priests retain their position for life. Five of his sons and his son-in-law Caiaphas became high priests after him. According to the Gospel of John, when Jesus was arrested, he was brought to Annas for his initial interrogation before he was turned over to Caiaphas for the official trial (John 18:13-24).\nCaiaphas was the official Jewish high priest around AD 18–36. He worked closely with his powerful father-in-law, Annas. Caiaphas had argued in the high council that it would be better for Jesus to be sacrificed than for the entire nation to be destroyed (John 11:49-50). These prophetic words were given to him by God because of his role as high priest (John 11:51-52). At the trial of Jesus, Caiaphas tore his robes at Jesus’ claim to be the Son of God and urged the high council to condemn him for blasphemy (Matt 26:57-66).\nNot long after the execution of Jesus, the Jewish authorities became increasingly disturbed over the rapidly growing numbers of believers in Christ. Annas and Caiaphas actively involved themselves in the interrogation of Peter and John over their healing a crippled beggar and their preaching about the resurrection of the dead (Acts 4:5-7).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 26:3-5, 57-67; Mark 14:53-65; Luke 3:2; John 11:49-53; John 18:13-28; Acts 4:5-7",

    "content": "Thomas\nThomas, also known as “the Twin,” was one of the twelve apostles (Matt 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13). He is remembered most for his unbelieving response to Jesus’ resurrection.\nNothing is known of how Jesus first met and called Thomas to be his disciple. The only personal accounts of Thomas are found in the Gospel of John. Thomas voiced his willingness to follow Jesus, even if it meant death (John 11:16); he openly told Jesus that he didn’t understand what he was saying (John 14:5); and he was one of the seven disciples who returned to fishing after the resurrection, when Jesus appeared to them (John 21:2).\nWhen Jesus first appeared to his disciples after his death, Thomas was not present. When Thomas heard the report from the others, he did not believe it, insisting he would have to see the evidence of the crucifixion on Jesus’ body with his own eyes and feel it with his own hands (John 20:19-25). A week later, when Jesus once again appeared to the disciples, he specifically addressed Thomas, telling him to examine the marks of the nails and the spear on his body and challenging him to believe and not be skeptical (John 20:26-27). Thomas’s response represents one of the strongest statements of Jesus’ deity in the New Testament and serves as the culmination of the Gospel of John’s portrayal of Jesus: “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28).\nLater tradition speaks of Thomas working as a missionary in the East: in Parthia (Eusebius), Persia (Jerome), and India (Acts of Thomas). The Mar Thoma church on the west coast of India traces its roots back to the early missionary work of Thomas. The historical reliability of these accounts is uncertain.\nThomas’s name is also unreliably linked to several later apocryphal writings: the Acts of Thomas, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, the Epistle to the Apostles, the Apocalypse of Thomas, the Book of Thomas the Athlete, and especially the Gospel of Thomas, a Gnostic collection of Jesus’ sayings.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; John 11:16; 14:5; John 20:24-29; 21:2Acts 1:13",

    "content": "Barnabas\nBarnabas is presented in Acts as a model Christian leader. A native of Cyprus, Barnabas was active in the Jerusalem church and demonstrated unselfish generosity in meeting the needs of the poorer members of that community (Acts 4:32-37). His given name was Joseph, but he was nicknamed Barnabas (“Son of Encouragement,” 4:36), which indicates his character. He was a suitable person to give a fair and open-minded assessment of the new work in Antioch (11:19-22). Barnabas perceived God’s blessing there and “encouraged the believers to stay true to the Lord” (11:23). His sterling character was clear in his transparent goodness, abundant faith, and Spirit-filled life and work (11:24). The Holy Spirit chose Barnabas and Saul for a special work (known to us as the first missionary journey), and they were sent out by the church at Antioch (13:1-3).\nBarnabas’s wisdom is evidenced in his earlier trip to Tarsus to find Saul (11:25). Barnabas had been impressed by the boldness of Saul’s preaching as a new Christian in Damascus and had taken him to the apostles, providing a vital introduction for a man who was under suspicion for his previous unrelenting attacks against believers. Through Barnabas’s intervention, Saul obtained needed contact with the original apostles, received their acceptance, and preached fearlessly in Jerusalem until he was forced out of the city (9:26-30). Barnabas’s trip was successful, and for a full year the two worked together in the Antioch church, drawing large crowds (11:26).\nBarnabas was an impressive figure (note his reception in Lystra as Zeus, 14:8-18). He was John Mark’s cousin and mentor and played a major role in giving John Mark a second chance to make good as a Christian leader after he had abandoned an earlier mission (15:36-40).\nBarnabas knew peer pressure, and he gave in to it on one occasion even though he knew better (Gal 2:11-13). Barnabas wasn’t perfect, but he was a “Son of Encouragement,” to many and a generous, unselfish man who fostered growth in others and in the church.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 4:36-37; 9:26-28; 11:19-30; 13:1–15:40; Gal 2:1-14",

    "content": "Stephen\nStephen was an exemplary early Christian who, as a result of the boldness of his witness, was arrested and killed by the Jewish authorities. He is known as the first Christian martyr.\nStephen was one of seven men chosen to help administer the distribution of food to needy Christians in Jerusalem (Acts 6:1-6). He was the most prominent of the seven and is singled out as a man “full of faith and the Holy Spirit” (6:5). Manifesting the grace and power of God in an unusual measure, he did miraculous things (6:8) and proved to be a bold and effective evangelist and defender of the faith (6:9-10). His witness was so powerful, he was soon arrested by the authorities and brought before the high council for interrogation (6:9-12).\nWhen witnesses accused Stephen of speaking against the sacred Temple and the law of Moses (Acts 6:13-14; cp. Mark 13:2; John 2:19; 4:21), he defended himself before the Jewish high council (Acts 7:1-53). He spoke of Israel’s long history of resisting God and his servants—first Moses and now the Prophet whom Moses had predicted (7:51-53). The Jewish authorities, infuriated by Stephen’s bold accusations, dragged him outside the city and stoned him to death (7:54-60). As he died, Stephen prayed that they might be forgiven (7:60).\nStephen’s bold witness gave rise to the first wave of persecution of the early Christians (8:1-3). But this persecution resulted in the Good News spreading even wider as the believers fled Jerusalem and proclaimed the message of Jesus everywhere they went (8:4; 11:19-21). Stephen’s martyrdom thus marks the beginning of the spread of the Good News beyond the borders of Judea.\nStephen’s life reminds us of the determined opposition that a faithful Christian witness can provoke. A bold testimony for Christ may be costly (see Rev 2:10, 13), but there is no insuperable barrier to the growth of the church (see Matt 16:18; Acts 8:1-4).\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 6:5–8:2; 11:19; 22:20",

    "content": "Philip\nPhilip was one of the first to take the Good News of Christ to those outside the borders of Judea. Well respected among the early Christians, he was one of seven men chosen to administer the food-distribution program for needy believers in Jerusalem (Acts 6:1-6). Philip was a strong and effective evangelist in the power of the Spirit.\nWhen Christians were forced to flee Jerusalem following the death of Stephen (8:1-5), Philip carried the Good News of Christ north to the ethnically mixed city of Samaria. There he performed many miraculous healings and exorcisms, and people responded eagerly to his message (8:5-8). Many men and women were baptized, including a notorious sorcerer named Simon (8:9-13). Then, directed by an angel, Philip traveled southwest from Jerusalem toward Gaza (8:26). There, directed by the Spirit, he met the treasurer of Ethiopia, who was returning home after visiting Jerusalem (8:27-28). When the Ethiopian asked Philip to help him understand Isaiah 53, Philip told him the Good News about Jesus (Acts 8:30-35), then baptized the man by the roadside (8:36-38). Philip was then suddenly taken away by the Spirit of God to the town of Azotus (8:39-40), where he again preached the Good News. He traveled through all the coastal towns until he came to the large Roman city of Caesarea on the coast, where he evidently settled down (8:40; 21:8-9).\nMany years later, Paul spent a night in Philip’s home in Caesarea (21:8). By this time Philip was known as Philip the Evangelist. He had raised four unmarried daughters, all of whom had the gift of prophecy (21:9).\nPhilip exemplifies early Christian evangelists, whom the Holy Spirit empowered and guided to authenticate their witness (see also 1:8; 3:4-8; 5:12-16; 6:8; 10:9-20; 13:2; 16:6-10; 19:11-12; 20:22-23). Philip submitted to the power and guidance of the Spirit, and God used him to take the Good News to those beyond the borders of Judea.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 6:5; 8:4-13, 26-40; 21:8-9",

    "content": "Paul (Saul)\nPaul was a leading persecutor of the early Christians who later became an apostle of Jesus Christ, the most illustrious of the early Christian missionaries, and the great apostle to the Gentiles. He has done more to shape Christianity than any other individual except Christ himself. We know about him from Luke’s account of his conversion and ministry in Acts and from the thirteen letters bearing his name in the New Testament.\nPaul was born in Tarsus to Jewish parents who were Roman citizens (which enabled him to also acquire Roman citizenship) and grew up in a traditional Jewish home. A tentmaker (or leatherworker) by trade, he was educated as a Pharisee by the well-known rabbi Gamaliel in Jerusalem. He became active in the violent persecution of Christians as a young man (Acts 22:3-5). But through a life-changing, personal revelation of the resurrected Jesus (9:3-6; 22:6-10), he was radically converted. He then dedicated the rest of his life to proclaiming Jesus as Savior and Lord throughout the Mediterranean world (see Gal 1:11-16). His dedication and hard work, especially among Gentiles (to whom he was specifically called), resulted in the founding of scores of churches during the first century. Most of his letters were written to these churches.\nPaul’s belief in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah set him apart from his Jewish contemporaries. His vision of Jesus brought him to the realization that Jesus’ death and resurrection bring righteousness and life-transforming power to those who believe in him. Paul no longer understood righteousness in terms of the careful observance of the law of Moses, but as a gift from God to those who put their trust in Christ, the Savior who died for their sins (Rom 4:1-8). And he was convinced that this gift is for Gentiles as well as Jews.\nPaul’s thirteen letters deal with a wide range of issues, such as salvation and what Christians believe about Christ (Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians), specific problems in the church (1 Corinthians), the nature of Christian life and community (Ephesians, Colossians), and questions about Paul’s own authority as an apostle (2 Corinthians, Galatians). Some of his letters are intended to encourage young believers who are suffering for their faith (Philippians, 1 Thessalonians) or to correct false teachings (Galatians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians). Still others are written to individuals, giving specific advice related to their life and ministry (1–2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon). Together, these thirteen letters reveal much about the life of the earliest Christians and the problems they faced, and about Paul’s own grace-centered understanding of the Christian faith and life.\nPaul’s letters, with their strong focus on Christ, reflect his all-consuming passion for Christ and his twin convictions that (1) salvation is given only to those who put their faith in Christ as Savior (Gal 2:16), and (2) every part of a believer’s life is to be devoted to serving Christ as Lord (Rom 14:7-9; 2 Cor 5:15). Of all the New Testament writers, it is Paul who spells out most clearly what salvation is (Rom 1–8) and gives us the fullest picture of the Christian life and Christian community. Paul’s letters also highlight the power of the Holy Spirit in believers’ lives (Rom 8:9-13; Gal 5:16-25; cp. Gal 2:20; Col 1:27). He encourages believers to pursue the high standard of a life that is truly like Christ (Rom 8:30; Eph 4:13, 15; 5:1-2). Believers are to live a life of love (1 Cor 13:1-13; Eph 5:2) and fully submit to Christ. Paul, more than any other New Testament writer, shows us how and why Christians must always find their deepest roots and motivation in the grace of Christ (Rom 12:1-2). For Paul, the whole of a believer’s life—and indeed, the entire universe—is centered in Christ and Christ alone; everything finds its true meaning only in relation to him (Col 1:15-20; 2:6–3:4).\nLuke’s account of Paul’s missionary life, which spans a period of perhaps thirty years, begins with Paul’s preaching in Damascus shortly after his conversion (around AD 32–35) and ends with his imprisonment in Rome (AD 60–62). But the Pastoral Letters (1 Timothy—Titus) appear to be dated to a later time, and reliable later traditions affirm that Paul was released from prison (around AD 62) and continued his missionary activity. He was later rearrested, and after a lifetime of suffering as an evangelist for Christ, he was finally killed in Nero’s persecution of Christians around AD 64–67. Paul’s desire, not only to suffer as Christ suffered but also to die as Christ died, was thus fulfilled—with the sure hope of one day being resurrected, just as Christ was resurrected (Phil 3:10-11).\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 7:58–8:3; 9:1-31; 11:25-30; 12:25–28:31; Rom 1:1–16:27; 1 Cor 1:1–16:24; 2 Cor 1:1–13:14; Gal 1:1–6:18; Eph 1:1–6:24; Phil 1:1–4:23; Col 1:1–4:18; 1 Thes 1:1–5:28; 2 Thes 1:1–3:18; 1 Tim 1:1–6:21; 2 Tim 1:1–4:22; Titus 1:1–3:15; Phlm 1:1-25; 2 Pet 3:15-16",

    "content": "Herod Agrippa I\nHerod Agrippa I was Herod the Great’s grandson, Herod Antipas’s nephew, and Herodias’s brother. Agrippa I ruled the whole of Palestine for a short time following the death of Jesus, during the very early days of the Christian movement (AD 41–44).\nWhile at school in Rome, Agrippa lived a wanton life, incurring many debts. At one point he stated that he wished his friend Gaius Caligula were emperor rather than Tiberius. This was reported to Tiberius, who imprisoned him. He remained in prison until Tiberius’s death six months later.\nUpon Caligula’s accession to the throne, he rewarded Agrippa by releasing him and giving him Philip the Tetrarch’s territories and the northern part of Lysanias’s territory as well as the title of king. This title aroused the jealousy of Herodias, and Herod Antipas (her husband) was both critical and jealous of Agrippa. Agrippa responded by accusing Antipas of conspiracy and orchestrating Antipas’s banishment. Agrippa then acquired all of Antipas’s territories and property (AD 39).\nWhen his friend Caligula died in AD 41, Agrippa curried the favor of the new emperor, Claudius, whereupon Claudius added Judea and Samaria to Agrippa’s domain—territory once ruled by his grandfather, Herod the Great.\nAgrippa was an active persecutor of the early Christians. He is remembered for killing the apostle James and having Peter arrested—acts which gained him the favor of the Jews (Acts 12:1-4). The Jews, for their part, liked him more than any of the other Herods. Agrippa died suddenly in AD 44 shortly after his subjects hailed him as a god (Acts 12:20-23; see also Josephus, Antiquities 19.8.2; 19.9.1; War 2.11.5).\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 12:1-4, 18-23",

    "content": "John Mark\nJohn Mark, writer of the earliest Gospel (the Gospel of Mark), was an assistant of three early missionaries—Barnabas, Paul, and Peter.\nMark was taken along as an assistant by Barnabas and Paul on their first missionary journey. However, for unknown reasons, he left them to return to Jerusalem before the trip was completed (Acts 12:25; 13:4-5, 13). Because of this, when Barnabas wanted to take him along on the second trip, Paul flatly refused. The sharp disagreement that resulted broke the team apart: Barnabas took Mark (his cousin) with him, while Paul chose Silas, and the two pairs went their separate ways (15:36-41).\nLater, it appears that Paul and Mark were reconciled and that Mark once again served as his assistant. In Colossians, Paul refers to him as a coworker and suggests that he may soon be sending him to visit the church in Colosse (Col 4:10; see also Phlm 1:24). Still later, when Paul was awaiting execution in prison in Rome, he asked Timothy to bring Mark with him, for he thought Mark would be helpful to him in his ministry (2 Tim 4:11).\nMark also appears to have assisted Peter when Peter was engaged in missionary work in Italy near the end of his life. In one of Peter’s letters, he speaks endearingly of Mark as his “son” who is with him (1 Pet 5:13). Early Christian tradition speaks of Mark as Peter’s “interpreter” and indicates that it was from Peter himself that Mark got the information for his account of the life and words of Jesus (Eusebius, Church History 3.39.16). Generally considered to be the earliest of all the Gospels, Mark’s Gospel was almost certainly one of the key sources used by Matthew and Luke when they later wrote their own Gospels. For this reason, Mark’s Gospel is one of the most influential of all the early Christian writings.\nMark’s story reminds us that God can overcome human failings and restore rocky relationships for the sake of Christ and the Good News. Early failures do not disqualify a person from a life of effective service and even lasting significance.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 12:12, 25; 13:4-5, 13; 15:36-39; Col 4:10; 2 Tim 4:11; Phlm 1:23-24; 1 Pet 5:13",

    "content": "James, Brother of Jesus\nJames, one of Jesus’ brothers (Matt 13:55; Mark 6:3; Gal 1:19; cp. Jude 1:1), became the recognized leader of the church in Jerusalem shortly after Jesus’ resurrection. He is traditionally recognized as the author of the book of James.\nThough Jesus’ brothers were initially skeptical of his claims (John 7:2-5), they later became believers (Acts 1:14). James’s personal encounter with the resurrected Jesus (1 Cor 15:7) might have helped convince him. Two of Jesus’ brothers (James and Jude) are known to have played significant roles in the early Christian community. James quickly rose to the position of leader of the church in Jerusalem. At the council in Jerusalem, James was instrumental in getting the Jewish church leaders to accept Gentile believers without requiring that they be circumcised—a decision of major importance for Paul and the early mission to Gentiles (Acts 15:13-21). Paul visited James in Jerusalem after his third missionary trip (Acts 21:18), just as he had done earlier, following his conversion (Gal 1:19).\nLike most Jewish Christians, James continued to observe the law of Moses. He emphasized the need for believers to observe certain key laws when among Jews (Acts 15:20-21; 21:18-25). James acknowledged the validity of Paul’s missionary calling and emphasis on salvation by faith alone (Gal 2:6-9), but many Jewish Christians did not. These Jewish believers—whom Paul does link with James on one occasion (see Gal 2:12)—demanded that Gentile converts be circumcised and observe the law of Moses in order to join the Christian community.\nJames’s Jewish background is reflected in his letter, which is full of wise, practical advice for living, much of it in line with the traditional wisdom teaching of Jewish Scripture. One paragraph of his letter (Jas 5:1-6) reads very much like the work of the Old Testament prophets (e.g., cp. Amos 5:21-24; 6:1-7).\nJames, titled “the Just” by his contemporaries, was apparently put to death for his faith by Jewish priests in Jerusalem (Josephus, Antiquities 20.9; Eusebius, Church History 2.23.4–18).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 13:55; Mark 6:3; Acts 12:17; 15:13-21; 21:18-25; 1 Cor 15:7; Gal 2:9, 12; Jas 1:1–5:20; Jude 1:1",

    "content": "Luke\nLuke, a Gentile medical doctor who became a convert and trusted assistant of Paul in his missionary work, wrote both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles—roughly one-quarter of the New Testament.\nThough we know very little about Luke’s background, he seems to have first encountered Paul and his preaching in western Asia Minor, where he became a convert. Leaving his home, he devoted his life to the service of Christ and the Good News as a dedicated assistant of Paul. Paul speaks of him warmly as “the beloved doctor” and one of his faithful “coworkers” (Col 4:14; Phlm 1:24). Luke is the only Christian who faithfully remained with Paul when Paul was awaiting execution in Rome (2 Tim 4:11). And he is the only Gentile to have his writings included in the New Testament.\nAccompanying Paul on his last trip to Jerusalem, Luke probably acquired the information for his Gospel and the early part of the book of Acts from people he interviewed in Judea while Paul was imprisoned there for two years. Having talked extensively with people who heard and saw Jesus, and having carefully studied what others had written about him, Luke then wrote his own careful account of Jesus’ life and teachings (see Luke 1:1-4).\nWhen Paul was sent by ship to Rome to have his case tried there, Luke accompanied him. While Paul was under house arrest, awaiting his trial, Luke might have used the time to write the book of Acts. The first fifteen chapters provide a chronological account of the earliest missionary work as told to him by the early followers of Christ—and probably by Paul himself. But beginning at Acts 16:10—the point at which Luke joined Paul’s team—he provides a direct eyewitness account. In Acts, Luke emphasizes the way the Holy Spirit empowered and guided the early missionaries in their witness (see Acts 1:4-5, 8). The book ends with Paul still under house arrest in Rome (28:30-31).\nWe are indebted to Luke for many unique passages including his account of Jesus’ birth, descriptions of Jesus’ ministry to women, many words about Jesus caring for the poor, and the only comprehensive account of the first thirty years of Christian missionary activity—all carefully documented. Through Luke’s writings we gain a much deeper appreciation of the crucial work of the Holy Spirit in the ministry of Jesus and the early missionaries.\nPassages for Further Study\nLuke 1:3; Acts 1:1; 16:10; Col 4:14; 2 Tim 4:11; Phlm 1:24",

    "content": "Priscilla and Aquila\nPriscilla and Aquila were a Christian couple with whom Paul lived and worked during his early days in Corinth. They were later active in Christian ministry and instrumental in bringing Apollos to a true understanding of Christ. They made a habit of opening their home in hospitality to other Christians.\nPaul first met Priscilla and Aquila in Corinth, where they had recently arrived as a result of Claudius Caesar’s deportation of all Jews from Rome (AD 49). Paul became acquainted with them and, because they were tentmakers (or possibly leatherworkers) like he was, Paul lived and worked with them during his first year and a half in Corinth (AD 50–52; 18:1-3).\nWhen Paul left Corinth, he took Priscilla and Aquila with him and left them in Ephesus (18:18-19) while he returned to Jerusalem and Antioch. Later, when Apollos came through Ephesus, enthusiastically preaching about Jesus in the synagogues, Priscilla and Aquila took him aside and explained to him more fully the truth of Christ. As a result of their training, Apollos went on to become a powerful evangelist and Christian apologist (18:24-28).\nLater, Paul speaks of their home as a meeting place for Christians in Ephesus, and he sends their greeting with his own to the church in Corinth (1 Cor 16:19; cp. 2 Tim 4:19). Still later, it seems they returned to Rome (presumably after the relaxation of Claudius’s edict), for they are the first of many to whom Paul sends his greetings when he writes to the church in Rome (Rom 16:3-5). Here, too, their home became a meeting place. It is clear that Paul felt a close bond of friendship with them and that he regarded their work for Christ highly—he speaks of them as “my coworkers in the ministry of Christ,” and he refers to a time when they even risked their lives for him.\nPriscilla and Aquila are examples of early Christians who, in the course of their daily work, were bold in bearing witness to Christ and active in ministering to his people—in this case, as a married couple dedicated to the service of Christ. The fact that Priscilla’s name often occurs first (which was unusual for the time) might say something about the strong role she played in the couple’s witness and ministry.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 18:1-3, 18-19, 24-28; Rom 16:3-5; 1 Cor 16:19; 2 Tim 4:19",

    "content": "Apollos\nApollos was a Hellenistic (Greek-speaking) Jew, well versed in Scripture, who became a strong evangelist and Christian apologist. A native of Alexandria in Egypt, where there was a large Jewish community, Apollos apparently came under the influence of John the Baptist’s followers. He then became a bold and enthusiastic preacher of Jesus in Jewish synagogues, though he knew nothing of Christian baptism.\nWhen Priscilla and Aquila heard Apollos preach in Ephesus, they invited him to their home and explained the way of Christ to him more fully. With the encouragement of the believers in Ephesus, who recognized his God-given gifts and ministry, Apollos then traveled on to Achaia (i.e., Corinth). There he greatly helped the believers as an effective defender of the Good News in public debate with the Jews, boldly demonstrating that Jesus is the Messiah predicted in Scripture (Acts 18:24-28).\nA dynamic communicator, Apollos was popular with some of the Christians in Corinth because of his intellectual style and his powerful speaking abilities. As a result of his powerful ministry, some in Corinth were more drawn to Apollos than to Paul (1 Cor 1:11-12). Paul’s defense of himself and his simple, unimpressive way of preaching the Good News may have been precipitated by comparisons that people were making between him and Apollos. Significantly, Paul nowhere criticized Apollos himself. He called Apollos a fellow servant and was grateful for the follow-up work he had done—Apollos watered the seed that Paul had planted, and God blessed the work of both (1 Cor 3:5-9; 4:1). Rather, Paul criticized the shallow perspectives and divisiveness of those drawn to Apollos for superficial reasons (see 1 Cor 1:10-12; 3:3-4; 4:6-7).\nPerhaps Apollos’s reluctance to return to Corinth from Ephesus (1 Cor 16:12) was due to concern over the divisions that resulted from his ministry. Yet Paul encouraged him to return there at some point. Several years later, when Apollos was ministering on the island of Crete, Paul encouraged Titus to make sure Apollos’s needs were met as he set off to an unknown destination for further missionary service (Titus 3:13). Apollos, with his strong intellectual gifts and powerful speaking abilities, had a significantly different approach and style from that of Paul, yet both men proved effective and useful in the service of Christ.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 18:24–19:1; 1 Cor 1:10-12; 3:3-9; 4:1, 6-7; 16:12; 2 Cor 10:10; Titus 3:13",

    "content": "Herod Agrippa II\nHerod Agrippa II, son of Herod Agrippa I, succeeded his father as king and ruled in Palestine AD 50–100, eventually controlling approximately the same area as his great-grandfather, Herod the Great. Agrippa II was in control of the Temple treasury and could appoint the high priest. He was not popular among Jews on account of his incestuous relationship with his sister Bernice. The Romans consulted him on religious matters, which is probably why Festus invited him to hear the apostle Paul’s defense at Caesarea (AD 59, 25:13–26:32).\nIn May AD 66, the Jewish war against the Romans began (Josephus, War 2.14.4). When Agrippa’s attempt to quell the revolt failed, he became a staunch ally of the Romans throughout the entire war (AD 66–70). During this time Nero committed suicide, the new emperor Galba was murdered, and Vespasian became the emperor. After pledging his allegiance to the new emperor, Agrippa associated himself with Titus, Vespasian’s son, who was the general in charge of the war (Tacitus, History 5.81). After the fall of Jerusalem (Aug 6, AD 70), Agrippa was probably present to celebrate the destruction of his own people.\nIn AD 79 Vespasian died and Titus became emperor. Little is known of Agrippa’s rule after this, except that he wrote to the historian Josephus, praising him for The Jewish War, and he purchased a copy of it (Josephus, Life 65; Against Apion 1.9.47–52).\nAlthough the Talmud implies that Agrippa II had two wives (Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 27a), Josephus gives no indication that he had any wives or children. He died around AD 100, and his death marks the end of the dynasty of the Herods.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 25:13–26:32",

    "content": "Rome\nIn the first century AD Rome was both a cosmopolitan city and a mighty empire that had brought peace and stability to the Mediterranean world.\nThe Founding and Early Growth of Rome\nRome was founded, according to tradition, in 753 BC on the Tiber River in Italy by a Latin-speaking agricultural tribe. A loose association of chieftains comprised the earliest Senate.\nAround 600 BC the Etruscans from central Italy invaded the territory of Rome and became its rulers. They constructed numerous works, including the forum, which became the social, commercial, and political center for the city, and a temple for Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. Rome was now linked by roads to the Etruscans in the north, to the Greek trading cities in the south, to the sea to the west, and to the inland highlands to the east.\nThe Roman Republic\nWhen Rome’s kings became autocratic, the Latin population rebelled. In 509 BC, Rome established a “republic,” an oligarchy of the powerful families who controlled the Senate. The small city-state steadily gained control of the region, expanding their influence across the Mediterranean. In 273 BC they made a treaty with the Ptolemies of Egypt. They expanded into North Africa, defeating the rival city-state Carthage in the course of the three Punic Wars (264–146 BC), and pressed on into Spain. Rome’s many conquests brought enormous wealth.\nWith geographical expansion came social changes in Italy. Between 200 and 100 BC, rich landowners bought out small independent farmers, who subsequently drifted into Rome, landless and unemployed. Huge, overcrowded slums appeared alongside the vast wealth and magnificent buildings. The foundations of the republic were cracking under the strain of popular discontent.\nThe Beginning of the Empire: Julius and Octavian\nDuring this time of social and political upheaval, Julius Caesar pursued an ambitious and tumultuous career which sought to centralize power in his own person. Senators who favored the old republic assassinated him in 44 BC, but their action ultimately backfired: Julius’s grandnephew and heir, Octavian, became a senator, consul, and the commander-in-chief in 43 BC with the support of the Senate. The Senate also deified Julius in 42 BC. After Octavian defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra in 31 BC and took control of Egypt, the Senate gave him the titles Augustus (“illustrious”) and Princeps (“first citizen”) in 27 BC, and Octavian began to call himself “son of a god” because of Julius’s divine status. The form of a republic survived, but the reality of a divine emperor had arrived.\nJesus and the Birth of the Church\n“When the right time came, God sent his Son” (Gal 4:4). The change into an empire brought peace and stability, a pax Romana (“Roman peace”) that lasted well into the 100s AD. Many observers have noted that Roman rule during the first century AD provided the ideal setting for the spread of Christianity. The borders were secure and the roads were good, making travel relatively trouble-free. Roman laws and customs protected the rights of its citizens (see, e.g., Acts 16:35-40; 22:24-29). Judaism was protected, and the Romans viewed Christianity as a sect within Judaism (see, e.g., Acts 25:13-19). As a result, the Romans largely rejected complaints against Christians on religious grounds (see, e.g., Acts 19:23-41). Christians were free to proclaim the Good News about Jesus, and many people of all nationalities became followers of Christ.\nThe Changing Status of Christianity\nThis favorable situation began to change in the time of Nero. Nero blamed Christians for the fire that destroyed a good part of Rome in AD 64, and he proceeded with the first large-scale persecution of Christians. The overt persecution ceased in AD 66, but Christianity was no longer viewed as a sect of Judaism and lost its protected status. It later became imperial policy to require people to burn incense to the emperor—those who refused were usually either Jews (who were protected) or Christians (who were not). As a result, from the time of Domitian (AD 81–96) to Galerius (AD 305–311), Christianity was officially illegal, punishable by death, and persecuted to varying extents depending on the zeal of those in power. Thus for over two hundred years Rome drank “the blood of God’s holy people who were witnesses for Jesus” (Rev 17:6).\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 2:10; 18:2; 19:21; 23:11; 28:14, 16; Rom 1:1-7, 15; 2 Tim 1:17",

    "content": "Nero\nNero became emperor of Rome in AD 54 at the age of 17 after his mother poisoned her husband, the emperor Claudius. Nero enjoyed performing in the limelight and was a sexually depraved and profligate man. Yet the early years of Nero’s reign were stable and competently administered by his advisers, the prefect Burrus and the Stoic philosopher Seneca. Nero’s debauched character would have been well known when Paul wrote to the Romans around AD 57 to “submit to governing authorities” as having been “placed there by God” (Rom 13:1).\nNero’s worst actions came after he arranged his mother’s murder in AD 59 (the same year in which Paul appealed to Caesar, Acts 25:11). In AD 62 he banished and then executed his wife, married his lover, and forced Burrus and Seneca into retirement. In AD 64 a fire devastated a large area of Rome. At the time, Nero was away from the city, but many people believed the rumor that Nero had set the fire himself. Nero found a scapegoat in Christians, whom he charged with the crime. Christians were widely seen as hostile to civil society and thus deserving of punishment, even if few believed that they had started the fire; they were “convicted not so much of arson as of hatred of the human race” (Tacitus, Annals 15.44). The ensuing persecution of Christians in Rome was intense; it is likely that Peter and Paul were executed in Rome at this time.\nIn AD 66 a Jewish revolt broke out in Caesarea. Nero dispatched his general Vespasian to squelch the revolt, taking no interest in the affairs of state. He spent the next two years doing performances in Greece, leaving the responsibility of governing to a Roman prefect. Because of the opposition he encountered from leading governors in France, Spain, and Africa on his return to Rome, Nero committed suicide in AD 68, exclaiming at his death, “What an artist dies with me!” He was the last and worst emperor of the line of Julius Caesar.

    "content": "The Roman Church\nThe details of the founding of the church in Rome are not known with certainty. There was a large Jewish population in Rome, and some Jews from Rome were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost at the birth of the church (Acts 2:10). The most likely explanation, then, is that some of these Jews converted to Christianity and took the Good News about Jesus the Messiah to Rome, where a Christian community was born from within the synagogues of Rome. It is unlikely that Peter founded the Roman church or that he was present in Rome by the time Paul wrote to the Roman Christians around AD 57; otherwise, Paul would certainly have greeted him. Consequently, Paul wrote this letter to help ensure that the Roman church had apostolic involvement in their faith. He never wrote to the churches of Judea, founded by the other apostles, but only to churches that either he had founded (e.g., Corinth, Galatia) or to those that had no direct apostolic involvement (e.g., Colosse, Rome).\nIn time, the Jewish Christians in Rome would have been pushed out of the synagogues by the non-Christian Jews, as happened elsewhere. By the time Paul wrote to the Roman church, they were meeting as separate house churches in private homes (Rom 16:5, 10-11, 15). There were no centralized edifices, and it is uncertain whether the whole body of believers in Rome met together.\nWhen Claudius expelled the Jews from Rome (around AD 49), the Jewish Christians were also forced to leave, among whom were Priscilla and Aquila (Acts 18:2). In the absence of the Jews, the Roman church would have become Gentile in character. When the Jews returned (probably shortly after the death of Claudius in AD 54), there were no doubt questions—if not conflicts—among the Jewish and Gentile Christians. Paul may have written Romans to settle such controversies among this mixed group of Jews and Gentiles worshiping Christ in the same city.\nAs is evident from Romans 16, Paul already had many friends in the Roman church. In the spring of AD 60, roughly two years after writing Romans, Paul had the opportunity to go to Rome—a desire he had repeatedly expressed (Acts 19:21; Rom 1:13-15). He spent two years there under house arrest awaiting his first trial before Nero, “boldly proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ” (Acts 28:30-31).\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 28:15-31; Rom 1:13-15; 16:1-16",

    "content": "Corinth\nCorinth was one of the oldest cities of Greece, with evidence of settlement going back to at least 3000 BC. Its prime location along both east-west and north-south trade routes enabled it to become a center of commerce and trade, and it reached the height of its strength and power between 800 and 600 BC. When in the mid-100s BC the Roman military machine began a relentless march to forge a vast empire, Corinth led the Hellenic League to oppose Roman dominance in Greece. They were no match for the Romans, and in 146 BC Corinth was completely destroyed, its men executed, its women and children sold into slavery. Corinth lay in ruins for a century.\nIn 44 BC Julius Caesar established a Roman colony at Corinth. The colony attracted a mixed group of Italians, freedmen (freed former slaves) from Rome, and dispossessed Greeks. With great industry and ingenuity the new inhabitants quickly reestablished the city as a prosperous center for trade, commerce, and industry. By the time Paul came to Corinth, it was a bustling cosmopolitan city with a population of almost 700,000, including many wealthy people, and many others who were struggling to become so. Corinth attracted tradespeople from all over the world, though its reputation also grew as a center of luxury, indulgence, and vice. Corinth had a reputation for promiscuity and prostitution, so much so that the verb “Corinthianize” meant having immoral sex. The church in Corinth struggled with sexual immorality (1 Cor 5:1-13; 6:12-20).\nCorinth was also prominent because of the Isthmian Games, which dated from 523 BC and occurred every two years. Competition centered on three kinds of events: equestrian, gymnastic, and musical. By the New Testament period, the games included chariot racing and other Roman spectacles in addition to the traditional Greek competitions. In an allusion to these athletic contests, Paul mentioned both running and boxing (1 Cor 9:24-26). The winners of the games were national heroes. The prize for winning the games was a wreath made of myrtle, olive, or pine branches, plus the additional benefits of a stipend from the state, remission of taxes, and special benefits for the champion’s children.\nAs in most Roman cities, marble temples dominated the landscape; participation in the worship of the gods and their feasts was a prominent part of life in Corinth. These pagan feasts were another major issue that the Corinthian church wrestled with (8:1–10:33).\nA large colony of displaced Jews also developed in the city, many of whom may have arrived after the emperor Claudius’s edict expelling Jews from Rome (see Acts 18:2). When Paul traveled to Corinth on his second missionary journey, he met Aquila and Priscilla, who became his close friends and co-workers (Acts 18:1-3). Paul stayed at Corinth for over a “year and a half, teaching the word of God” (Acts 18:11).\nThe church of Corinth, born in such a hothouse of paganism and promiscuity, went through serious birth pangs. Their troubles provide, through Paul’s letters to them, a rich collection of solutions to the practical issues of Christian life and community.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 18:1-18; 1 Cor 1:1-2; 16:5-20; 2 Cor 1:1; 13:1; 2 Tim 4:20",

    "content": "Ephesus\nEphesus stood at the crossroads of both north-south and east-west trade routes and was well known as the “guardian” of the temple of Artemis (Acts 19:35). It was founded by Ionian Greeks around 1044 BC on a natural harbor where the Cayster River emptied into a gulf of the Aegean Sea (the site of the ancient city is now well inland). The city came under Roman rule in 41 BC. At the time of the apostles, Ephesus was a wealthy city, a commercial and religious hub, and thus the most important city of the Roman province of Asia.\nThe worship of Artemis in Ephesus was nearly as ancient as the city itself. The temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was a key to the wealth and commerce of Ephesus, because the worship of Artemis brought many pilgrims to Ephesus and provided many commercial opportunities for idol makers and other vendors of goods and services.\nWhen Paul arrived on his third missionary journey in AD 53 (Acts 19), Ephesus had been a city continuously for over a thousand years and was deeply devoted to its patron goddess and her temple. As Paul’s message began to gain more adherents, Christianity threatened the pagan temple and the commerce it produced for the makers of idols. The ensuing riot almost cost the apostle Paul his life (Acts 19:24, 28-31).\nThe church of Ephesus became strong under Paul’s teaching and leadership, and churches in the surrounding communities were founded by people who had learned from Paul in Ephesus (e.g., Colosse; see Colossians Book Introduction, “Setting”). But Paul warned the leaders of the Ephesian church that they would be troubled by false teachers (Acts 20:29-31).\nThe apostle John is thought to have settled in Ephesus around AD 70; from there he was exiled to the island of Patmos (Rev 1:9), where he wrote Revelation (probably in the AD 90s). At that time, the commendable love and good works of the Christian community described in the letter to the Ephesians had been largely abandoned (Rev 2:4). Irenaeus records that, after John’s exile on Patmos, the apostle returned to live in Ephesus and lived there until the end of his life during the time of the emperor Trajan (AD 98–117). According to tradition, Mary the mother of Jesus also finished her days on earth in Ephesus under John’s care (see John 19:25-27).\nThe temple of Artemis was burned by the Goths in AD 262, and Artemis was no longer influential among the Ephesians when the third ecumenical council was held in Ephesus in AD 431, thus illustrating the truth of Paul’s message that “handmade gods” like Artemis “aren’t really gods at all” (Acts 19:26).\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 18:19–19:41; 20:16-38; Eph 1:1; Rev 2:1-7",

    "content": "Philippi\nPhilippi was a minor village of Thrace until about 357 BC, when Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, conquered the site and rebuilt it. He named the village after himself, fortified it as a military stronghold, and exploited the nearby gold mines. Philippi gained worldwide fame in 42 BC as the site where the imperial armies of Octavian and Mark Antony defeated the republican generals Brutus and Cassius, the assassins of Julius Caesar. The victory opened the way for the emergence of the Roman Empire under the rule of Octavian Augustus.\nMany veterans from the war of 42 BC and other battles settled in Philippi. When Paul came to the city, it still reflected its Roman military heritage. Situated on the Egnatian Way, it was a prominent stop on that great military highway connecting the Adriatic Sea with the Aegean Sea. It possessed distinct civic pride as a Roman colony (enjoying numerous privileges, such as tax exemption) and promoted Latin as its official language. Its government was modeled on the municipal constitution of Rome, and the inhabitants viewed themselves as Romans (see Acts 16:21).\nPaul visited the city on his second missionary journey, and the account of Acts gives detailed attention to this visit (Acts 16:12-40). The narrative frequently refers to the city’s Roman heritage: Not only does Paul successfully employ his Roman citizenship in his defense (Acts 16:37-39), but the city magistrates bear the dignified Latin title praetor (given in its Greek translation, stratēgos—Acts 16:20-22, 38). There also appears to have been a small Jewish community there. The church began with believing Jewish women who met outside the city because there was no synagogue. Later, they convened in the home of an important woman convert named Lydia (Acts 16:14-15, 40). Luke apparently stayed in Philippi when Paul departed for Thessalonica (cp. Acts 16:12, 40) and later rejoined Paul at Philippi when Paul passed through on his third missionary journey several years later (Acts 20:6). Paul wrote a cordial letter to the church at Philippi during one of his imprisonments.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 16:12-40; 20:6; Phil 1:1; 2:19-30; 4:2-3, 10-22; 1 Thes 2:2",

    "content": "Timothy\nTimothy traveled with Paul for much of his missionary career and was one of Paul’s best-loved and most trusted assistants. Two of Paul’s last letters were written to Timothy at a time when Timothy was providing leadership for the church in Ephesus, near the end of Paul’s life.\nTimothy had a devout mother and grandmother (2 Tim 1:5), and he was highly respected by the Christians in his hometown, Lystra, and in nearby Iconium. He joined Paul’s missionary team on Paul’s second missionary journey. Paul speaks of prophetic words that confirmed Timothy’s selection. Timothy also received a special gifting for service through the laying on of the hands of the elders and of Paul (1 Tim 1:18; 4:14; 2 Tim 1:6). Out of deference to the Jews in the area, Paul had Timothy circumcised (Acts 16:1-3).\nOver the next fifteen years, Paul sent Timothy on special assignments to several different churches (Acts 19:22; 1 Cor 4:17; 16:10-11; Phil 2:19-23; 1 Thes 3:1-6; 1 Tim 1:3; see also Acts 17:14-15; 18:5). Paul included Timothy’s name as coauthor of several of his letters (2 Cor 1:1; Phil 1:1; Col 1:1; 1 Thes 1:1; 2 Thes 1:1; Phlm 1:1). It is clear that Paul had a close relationship with Timothy and held him in high regard (see Rom 16:21; 1 Cor 4:17; 1 Thes 3:2; 1 Tim 1:2; 6:11; 2 Tim 1:2). As Paul neared the end of his life and awaited his sentence in prison, he longed to see Timothy (2 Tim 1:3-4). Of all Paul’s coworkers, Timothy especially is commended for his selfless concern for Christ and his people (Phil 2:20-22).\nIn Paul’s second letter to Timothy (2 Timothy), written shortly before Paul was killed, he encouraged Timothy to be bold and fearless in his proclamation of the Good News, willing to suffer for Christ (2 Tim 1:8; 2:1-3; 4:1-2, 5)—a strong word to one who might have been timid by nature (see 2 Tim 1:6-7). Timothy himself seems to have become a prisoner later on (Heb 13:23).\nTimothy was exemplary in the way he faithfully served the cause of Christ behind the scenes, devoting himself selflessly and with single-minded focus to the work of Christ and the people of Christ wherever help was needed. He serves as a reminder that believers should seek to become strong and effective witnesses for Christ.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 16:1-3; 17:14-15; 18:5; 19:22; 20:4; Rom 16:21; 1 Cor 4:17; 16:10-11; 2 Cor 1:1, 19; Phil 1:1; 2:19-23; Col 1:1; 1 Thes 1:1; 3:2-6; 2 Thes 1:1; 1–2 Tim; Phlm 1:1; Heb 13:23",

    "content": "Titus\nTitus was a Gentile convert who served as one of Paul’s trusted assistants. One of Paul’s last letters was addressed to him, when Titus was helping to consolidate the church at Crete. Titus is an example of the Gentile converts who were so deeply touched by the Good News of Christ that they left their homes and devoted their lives to assisting Paul in the proclamation of the Good News.\nWe know nothing about Titus’s background or conversion; his name is not mentioned in Acts. We first hear of him as a Gentile believer who accompanied Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem (Gal 2:1). Significantly, Paul emphasized that Titus was not compelled to be circumcised (Gal 2:3).\nLater, as a trusted member of Paul’s team, Titus was sent on special assignments. He was the one sent by Paul to Corinth to deal with a difficult situation there (apparently carrying the demanding letter mentioned in 2 Cor 2:4, 9; 7:8-9). This task required both tact and strong leadership (Titus’s personality seems to have been stronger than Timothy’s; see 1 Cor 16:10-11; 2 Cor 7:13-15; 2 Tim 1:6-7). When Titus returned to Paul with good news (2 Cor 7:6-7, 13-15), Paul sent him back to Corinth carrying the letter we call 2 Corinthians to encourage the believers to complete their money-raising project for the poor believers in Jerusalem. It was an assignment he eagerly accepted because of his love for the Christians in Corinth (2 Cor 7:15; 8:6, 16-17). Paul speaks of him as a person of integrity and as one who is similar to Paul himself (2 Cor 8:23; 12:18).\nA few years later, following Paul’s first trial in Rome and subsequent release, Paul left Titus on the island of Crete to help consolidate the church. While Titus was there, Paul wrote his letter to Titus, giving him advice on choosing church leaders and encouraging him to teach and model godly behavior. Paul then asked Titus to meet him at Nicopolis (in Achaia), where Paul hoped to spend the winter (Titus 3:12). Later, shortly before Paul was killed in Rome, he wrote that Titus had gone to Dalmatia (along the Adriatic coast, northwest of modern-day Greece), probably for ministry there (2 Tim 4:10).\nThe church historian Eusebius refers to an early tradition that Titus eventually settled on Crete, serving as the bishop there until he was quite old (Eusebius, Church History 3.4.6).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Cor 2:13; 7:6, 13-14; 8:6, 16-17, 23; 12:18; Gal 2:1, 3; 2 Tim 4:10; Titus 1:4; 2:1",

    "content": "The Creation\nThe creation account is foundational to the message of the entire Bible. Understanding the early chapters of Genesis is thus crucial to forming a biblical worldview.\nThese opening chapters deal with fundamental questions: Who created the world, and for what purpose? Why is the world in its present condition? Genesis answers these questions, dispelling the idolatry that Israel had acquired from their pagan masters in Egypt. In the Promised Land, the Israelites would again be surrounded by people who believed in false gods and worshiped created things rather than the Creator. Genesis taught Israel that the one true God created and has absolute authority over all things; he alone is worthy of worship.\nGod transformed chaos into the present ordered cosmos. In the first three days, he transformed the formless void into the structured universe—the heavens, the water and sky, and the earth. In the second three days, he populated each realm. The seventh day, God’s day of rest, provides the weekly pattern for human activity and points forward to the rest that God promised to those who live by faith in him (see Heb 3:7–4:11).\nThe creation account teaches that as God made the world, it was “very good” (Gen 1:31). In this environment, humans enjoyed unbroken fellowship with their Creator until their rebellion severed that fellowship and implanted evil in human hearts (see Gen 3–6). The world’s evil does not come from some defect in creation; rather, it stems from rebellion to God’s design and purposes.\nSince that first rebellion, humans have been alienated from the Creator and are prone to not recognize his presence and authority. This alienation results in shame, fractured relationships with God and other humans, estrangement from the rest of creation, and death (3:7-19). Since that time, God has been working purposefully in history to restore humans to fellowship with him, which he is doing through Jesus Christ. Restored humans are a new creation (see Gal 6:15); through Jesus, eternal life is open to all and God will one day renew all things (see Isa 65:17-25; Rom 8:19-22). The whole cosmos will be made new (Rev 21:1).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:1–2:3; Ps 33:6-9; Prov 3:19; 8:22-31; Isa 40:26-28; 45:11-12, 18-19; Jer 10:11-16; John 1:1-4; Rom 8:18-25; 2 Cor 5:17; Col 1:15-20; Rev 4:11; 21:1-5",

    "content": "Human Sexuality\nWhen God created the first human beings in his own image, he created them as sexual beings, male and female (Gen 1:27). Through their sexuality, they were to fill and govern the world (1:28) and provide intimate companionship for one another in marriage (2:18-25). Male and female sexuality is central to what it means to be human and is included in God’s declaration of creation as “very good” (1:31).\nSexual intimacy united the first man and woman as one, an effect that sexual intimacy continues to have. Since biblical sexuality is not just physical but has the total person in view, it validates sexual relations only as part of the partners’ permanent mutual commitment to each other’s ultimate good. The Bible speaks of engaging in sexual intercourse as literally “knowing” another person intimately (see study note on Gen 4:1). Since Creation, God’s intended context for sexual activity has been the intimate union of marriage—namely, a permanent and loving heterosexual commitment (Gen 1:27-28; 2:23-24). The sexual relationship cements the marriage bond in an intimacy that may result in reproduction and can continue even when reproduction is no longer possible.\nAlthough sexuality was created before sin, it did not emerge unscathed from human rebellion. Sexuality is a powerful force that is easily corrupted if not carefully channeled (see Lev 18; 1 Thes 4:3-8). Sexual intimacy apart from marital commitment perverts the order that God intended for creation. Incest, for example, violates sexual boundaries (see Lev 18:7-18), collapses family structures (see Gen 19:30-38), and fragments the community. Whereas perverted sexuality causes much harm, tears the community down (see Gen 38:1-30; 39:7-9; Judg 19–20), and exalts the individual (see 2 Sam 13:11-14), biblical sexuality builds up the sexual partners and the community.\nHuman sexuality has been damaged through our fall into sin (Gen 3), but God has redeemed it through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (see 1 Cor 6:12-20; Eph 5:31-33). He restores sexual wholeness in those who trust his work in their lives by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 6:9-11, 15-20; 1 Thes 4:1-8). Those who commit their sexuality to Christ’s work in their lives can serve as a testament to others of God’s love for his people (Eph 5:25-33).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:27-28; 2:18-25; Lev 18:1-30; Deut 22:13-29; Ruth 4:11-13; 2 Sam 11:2-27; Ps 127:3-5; Eccl 2:8-11; Song 1:8–8:14; Mal 2:15-16; Matt 19:3-12; 1 Cor 6:12–7:40; Eph 5:31-33; 1 Thes 4:3-8",

    "content": "Biblical Marriage\nAt the first wedding, God the Father gave the bride away to the groom and witnessed the couple’s interaction in his sanctuary-garden (Gen 2:18-25). Biblical marriage is a binding covenant commitment before God. Breaching that covenant (e.g., through adultery) is a sin against people and against God, who is a divine witness to and guarantor of the marriage covenant (see Mal 2:10-16; cp. Gen 39:6-9; Jer 3:1; 1 Cor 6:9-10; Heb 13:4). Although marriage is exclusive, it is not private. It is legally declared in public, with community recognition, witnesses, and accountability (see Lev 20:10-12; Deut 22:22; Jer 29:20-23).\nMarriage is also a metaphor of the Lord’s relationship with his people, first with Israel (see Exod 19:3-6; 20:2-6; 34:14; Isa 54:5; Ezek 16; Hos 2:19-20), and then with the church (see 2 Cor 11:2; Eph 5:21-33). A marriage points to something greater than itself—God’s people (Christ’s “bride”) await the return of Christ (the “groom”). Married Christians are called to live in unity and dignity as they anticipate the wedding feast of the Lamb (Rev 19:6-9). Christ will live forever with his faithful people in glory (Rev 19:7; 21:2, 9).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 2:18-25; 24:65-67; Ps 45:8-15; Isa 54:5; Hos 2:19-20; Mal 2:10-16; 1 Cor 7:1-40; 2 Cor 6:14-16; Eph 5:21-33; Heb 13:4; 1 Pet 3:1-7",

Alienated from God, one another, and creation, they also became subject to death.\nConsequently, all humans are “fallen”—born in sin, predisposed to sin (Gen 8:21; Job 4:17-21; Pss 51:5; 103:10; 143:2; Prov 20:9), and awaiting death. When the first man and woman ate the fruit in disobedience to God, they forfeited their own innocence and that of their children, the entire human race (Rom 5:12-14; 1 Cor 15:21-22, 45-49). The expression “original sin” denotes sin’s complete, universal infiltration into individual lives and human society as a result of human rebellion. As people yield to their inherited predisposition to sin, they become responsible for their own wrongdoing (Eccl 7:20; Rom 3:23).\nThe first man, Adam, introduced sin, but the “second Adam,” Jesus Christ, is sin’s antidote (1 Cor 15:3; 2 Cor 5:21). When Christ died as Redeemer, he made God’s salvation from sin available to all (John 3:16; Rom 1:16).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 3:1-19; 8:21; Exod 34:7; Job 4:17-21; Ps 51:5; Prov 22:15; Ezek 36:16-36; John 8:1-11; Rom 1:18–3:20; 5:12-21; 1 Cor 15:21-22; Gal 3:22; 5:17-24; Eph 2:1-10; 1 Jn 3:14",

    "content": "Retribution\nGod gave humans the commission of procreating and caring for the world (Gen 1:28). But as humanity multiplied, spiritual wickedness, violence, and murder also multiplied (4:8, 23; 6:5, 11-13), resulting in a corrupt world that required cleansing.\nThe purpose of the Flood was to enact God’s global cleansing and retribution against evildoers. Retribution means “giving what is due” and usually refers to recompense for wrongdoing. Retribution is motivated by the conviction that moral order is woven into the fabric of the world and must be maintained or restored (see Ps 7:14-16; Prov 11:17-21; 26:27).\nGod maintains moral order by meting out justice, punishing wickedness, and rewarding right behavior (Gal 6:7-8). Since God oversees the world, it is never entirely overwhelmed by moral chaos; God holds people accountable for what they do. The judgment and exile of Adam and Eve (Gen 3:8-24), Cain’s sentence (4:10-15), and the worldwide flood and annihilation (chs 6–7) are examples of God’s retribution. These events reveal a sovereign God who exacts just punishment in the context of his good intentions for the world (see also Num 16; Deut 30:15-20; Josh 7; Mic 2:1-3).\nRetribution is an application of God’s righteousness; it purifies the world for his kingdom of peace. Through retribution, the divine King proclaims his universal rule and exercises his justice on all who reject his rule or defy his commands (Deut 7:10; Ps 149; Prov 15:25; Mic 5:15; 1 Cor 16:22; Gal 1:8-9; 2 Thes 1:5-10).\nFor God’s people, retribution serves as his discipline. It is intended to restore covenant fellowship with him (see Isa 44:22; Jer 3:12-14; Lam 3:19-33; Hos 14:1-2; Joel 2:12-13; see also Heb 12:5-11). When God’s people experience his chastening, they can respond in hope because God’s truth and righteousness will triumph (Ps 58:10-11), and God will redeem and restore his people who trust in him (Lev 26:40-45; Hos 2:2-23).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 6:1–7:24; Lev 26:14-39; Ps 7:6-17; 57:6; 95:8-11; Prov 6:27-35; 26:27; Mic 2:1-3; Rom 2:5-16; Gal 6:7-8; Heb 10:26-31; 12:5-11, 25-29",

    "content": "God’s Covenant with Noah\nThe first explicit reference to a covenant in Scripture occurs immediately after the Flood (Gen 9:1-17).\nThe corruption and violence of the human race had provoked God’s anger (6:11-13), but his gracious favor remained with Noah (6:8). When God charged Noah to build an ark to escape the impending deluge (6:13-17), he also promised to establish a covenant with him (6:18). God took the initiative to bind himself again to human beings and to the whole creation despite human faithlessness (see 6:1-7). Through this covenant, God guaranteed that he would maintain a relationship with this one family even as other divine-human relationships were being severed. God’s covenant promise to Noah came with his command to build an ark (6:14); Noah’s receipt of the covenant blessing depended on his obedience to this divine command (6:22; 7:5).\nWhen Noah made an offering to God after the Flood (8:20-22), God elaborated on his covenant with Noah, indicating that it was a universal covenant with humans and with all living creatures (9:8-10). God promised never to send such a flood again as judgment on the world.\nThis covenant helps us understand God as a covenant maker. Although human beings deserve punishment because of their wickedness, God withholds ultimate destruction. God’s covenant with Noah did not establish an intimate relationship between God and each living being, but it recalibrated moral and ecological life to be as God intended it (9:1-7), leaving open the possibility of a more intimate covenant to come (see 17:1-21). Despite their evil, human beings are allowed to live in God’s world and seek a deeper relationship with the world’s Creator during their time on earth. God’s later covenants with his people made intimacy with him freely available to all (see Acts 2:22-40; 3:17-26).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 9:1-17; Ezek 14:12-23; Matt 24:37-39; Heb 11:7",

    "content": "Babel: The Dispersion of Nations\nThe story of the tower of Babel, whose peak was to reach to heaven, explains how nations and ethnic groups were separated by language barriers and scattered geographically. After the Flood, when God had judged an exceedingly wicked human race, humans again rebelled against their Creator by constructing a tower “that reaches into the sky” (Gen 11:4). Instead of worshiping the Lord, their intention was to exalt themselves and unify themselves apart from the Lord. God saw the danger that this posed: Their independence and arrogance would set them right back into a whirlpool of wickedness and, ultimately, destruction. So God intervened to “confuse the people with different languages” (11:7) and “[scatter] them all over the world” (11:9). Babel thus begins the history of differences and misunderstandings between peoples and nations who cannot understand one another’s languages and cultures—a separation that only begins to be reversed with the coming of the Holy Spirit (see Acts 2).\nAfter the dispersion of the nations at Babel, God renewed his relationship with humanity in Abraham and his descendants (Gen 12:1-9). In contrast with the people at Babel, Abraham was righteous because he “believed the Lord” and lived by faith in God rather than pride in his accomplishments (15:6; 17:1; 18:19; 26:5).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 11:1-9",

    "content": "God’s Covenants\nCovenant (Hebrew berith) means “bond”: A covenant is a binding relationship rooted in a commitment that includes promises and obligations. Whether between individuals (e.g., Gen 21:27), whole nations (e.g., Josh 9:15-18), or God and humans, the covenant relationship calls for faithfulness and makes peace and harmony possible.\nThe covenant theme in the Old Testament begins with Noah, through whom God made a covenant with all of creation. God promised to uphold the created order and gave the rainbow as the sign of this commitment (Gen 9:1-17).\nGod later established a covenant relationship with Abraham and his family; the sign of this covenant was circumcision (12:1-9; 15:1-21; 17:9-14). God’s covenant with Abraham promised descendants, land, rulers, and the blessing of all nations; these promises formed the basis for the covenants God later made with his people.\nGod’s covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai was a national covenant (Exod 19–24) whose sign was the Sabbath; it addressed how Israel would be the chosen people of God. This covenant took the form of a suzerain-vassal treaty, an ancient relationship established between a great king and loyal subjects (see study note on Exod 20:1–23:33).\nThe Sinai covenant was renewed in Deuteronomy and in Joshua 24:1-28. The renewal focused on God’s promise of land and how Israel would conduct itself while inhabiting the land. Through his covenant with Israel, God affirmed that he was their God and they were his people, a relationship that required their complete loyalty (Jer 11:4; 24:7; Ezek 11:20; 14:11). God, the great king, would bless and protect the nation Israel. Israel’s obligation was to keep God’s commands, decrees, and regulations (Exod 19:5, 8; 24:3, 7; Deut 30:15-20).\nGod later formed a covenant with King David (2 Sam 7:5-16), which pertained to the line of kings promised to Abraham and Jacob (Gen 17:6, 16; 35:11).\nYears later, at a low point in Israel’s history, the prophet Jeremiah foretold a “new covenant” in Israel’s future (Jer 31:31-33), in which the ideals of the covenants with Abraham and Israel would finally be realized. Jeremiah’s prophecy found fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus Christ (see Luke 22:20; Heb 8:6-13; 12:24). This new covenant provides the ultimate fulfillment of the previous promises that were made to God’s people.\nGod’s covenants were motivated by God’s faithful love (Hebrew khesed), which enabled a relationship to continue between God and his people. God initiated this relationship, announced its conditions, and rewarded his people accordingly. These covenants were not rewards but divine gifts. God may exclude people from the covenant relationship (see Hos 1:9), but he will not break, revoke, or withdraw his covenants. If broken or annulled by the human parties, the covenant could be renewed only through a reapplication of God’s faithful love (Exod 34:6-9; Jer 31:31-33). But while God’s love preserves the relationship, his grace must not be mocked (Isa 54:7-10; 55:3; 61:8; 1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 6:7).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 9:1-17; 12:1-9; 15:1-21; 17:9-14; Exod 6:2-5; 19:1–24:18; Lev 26:1-46; Deut 7:7-15; 29:2-29; Josh 8:30-35; 24:1-8; 2 Sam 7:5-16; Ezra 10:1-17; Isa 59:20-21; Jer 31:31-34; 33:19-26; 34:12-20; Ezek 16:1-63; Luke 22:20; Gal 4:21-31; Eph 2:11-13; Heb 8:6-13; 10:11-18; 12:24",

    "content": "God’s Covenant with Abraham\nThe Lord had already established a relationship with Abraham (Gen 12:1-9) before he made a formal covenant with him (ch Gen 15). God took all the initiative: He approached Abraham and spoke to him in a vision. God presented the impossible promise that the old man would have a son through whom his descendants would eventually be as numerous as the stars of heaven. Abraham believed God (15:6), and his faith proved to be an act of righteousness (see Hab 2:4; Rom 1:17; 4:3, 17; Gal 3:6, 11; Heb 10:37-38).\nIn the ancient Near East, kings sometimes granted land or other gifts to loyal subjects. The covenant of Genesis 15 includes a royal grant (15:18-21) in which God, the king, gave land to Abraham, his subject, as a possession and an inheritance. At the end of that day, Abraham knew that his future—and that of his descendants—was firmly in the hands of the covenant God. Later, the grant would be transferred to his descendants.\nGod later ratified his covenant with Abraham (17:1-22), giving him circumcision as its sign (17:10) and condition (17:9). The almighty God once again took the initiative (17:1-2) in granting Abraham an extraordinary privilege. The covenant was not a relationship between equals, yet both partners in the covenant assumed responsibilities. God committed himself voluntarily to Abraham and his descendants, while requiring faithfulness from Abraham (17:1, 9-14). The blessing Abraham received as God’s covenant partner was embodied in the new name that God gave him (17:5-6).\nGod’s covenant with Abraham also applied to his descendants (13:15-16; 15:3-5; 17:6-10). It pointed to blessing in the relatively near future when his descendants would possess the land (15:12-16). Much later, Abraham’s faith became a blessing to all through his descendant, Jesus Christ, through whom all the families of the earth can share in God’s blessing on Abraham (12:3; see Rom 4:11-25; Gal 3:8-9, 16).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:1-3; 15:1-21; 17:1-14; 21:1-2; 22:15-18; Exod 2:24; Deut 1:8; Neh 9:7-8; Ps 105:7-45; Luke 3:7-9; Acts 3:24-26; 7:2-8; Rom 4:11-25; 9:7-8; 11:16-17; Gal 3:6-9, 29; Heb 6:13-15",

    "content": "Circumcision\nCircumcision, the removal of the male foreskin, was practiced by a number of cultures in the ancient world (see Jer 9:25-26).\nGod chose circumcision as the sign of a covenant that focuses on descendants. God had promised to make Abraham and his descendants into a great nation (Gen 12:2; 17:3-6) and to use them to redeem the Gentile nations (12:3; see Gal 3:8-9). Circumcision was God’s signature in flesh; it would identify Abraham and his descendants as God’s own people (Gen 17:9-14) and remind them to live in faithfulness to the covenant.\nAlthough circumcision was applied to adult males when they joined the covenant community (Gen 17:23-27; Exod 12:48; Josh 5:3-7), it was usually performed on infants (Gen 21:4; Lev 12:3), who received God’s promises and membership in the covenant community through their parents. Faith was required in order to receive God’s blessings, however, as can be seen in the differentiation between Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob, and Joseph and his brothers. Non-Israelites could also obligate themselves to Israel’s covenant (Exod 12:48; cp. Gen 34:15-24), and circumcision marked their inclusion into the worshiping community (e.g., Exod 12:44).\nCircumcision would help Israel recognize and remember that they must lay aside natural impurity. God’s people had to be loyal to the covenant, to the family, and to their own marriages. Intermarriage with uncircumcised people who were not of the covenant was a violation of the covenant. Any man who refused to be circumcised (physically cut in this symbolic way) would be cut off from the covenant people because of his disobedience to God’s command (Gen 17:14).\nCircumcision is a symbol of separation from the world, of purity, and of loyalty to the covenant. It provides the powerful metaphor of “circumcision of the heart,” which designates a heart that is committed to God and is inwardly set apart to God, rather than being stubbornly resistant (Lev 26:41; Deut 30:6; Jer 4:4; 9:26; Eph 2:11). Circumcision of the heart evidences salvation and fellowship with God (see Ezek 18:31-32; 36:25-27; Rom 2:28-29; 4:11).\nWhen Jesus Christ established God’s new covenant, he fulfilled the requirements of the old covenant. It is not necessary for Gentile believers to be circumcised, since they are incorporated into the people of God through faith in Christ (Acts 15:1-29; Rom 2:25-29; Gal 2:1-10; 6:15; Col 2:11-12). One must turn in confidence to God and his promises, lay aside sinful behavior and the customs of the world, and live a new life by faith (see Jer 31:33-34; Rom 8:1-17; Gal 5:16–6:10).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 17:9-14, 23-27; 21:4; 34:1-26; Exod 4:24-26; 12:48; Lev 12:3; Josh 5:2-8; Jer 9:25-26; Ezek 44:7-9; Luke 1:59; 2:21; Acts 15:1-31; 16:1-5; Rom 2:25-29; 1 Cor 7:17-19; Gal 5:1-6, 11-12; 6:12-16; Eph 2:11-18; Phil 3:2-7; Col 2:11; 3:11",

    "content": "Altars\nThe first recorded altar in Scripture was built by Noah (Gen 8:20-21), though Cain and Abel gave God an offering (4:3-5). The patriarchs built numerous altars (see 12:7-8; 13:4, 18; 22:9; 26:25; 33:20; 35:1, 14-15). These altars designated sacred sites of divine revelation and personal land claims in the Promised Land, both north (in Shechem) and south (in Beersheba). Altars were made of stone, earth, brick, or metal and wood. Their table-like form allowed smoke to rise unhindered. Intended as a memorial or a place for sacrifice, an altar was the most common image of worship in the Old Testament and in the wider ancient world. The typical altar was on a raised platform accessed by a ramp or stairway; this elevated the sacrificial worship toward heaven. The four horns on the corners of many altars (see Exod 27:2) marked off the sacred space of meeting between divine and human realms. Through sacrifice and burning, the offering was transferred from the visible to the invisible world.\nJesus unites the various aspects of the altar imagery in himself as high priest, sacrificial lamb, and altar (see Heb 4:14-15; 7:24, 27; 9:14, 26; 10:10; 13:10, 12). Jesus anticipated his own sacrifice in his reference to the blood of martyrs (see Matt 23:35; Luke 11:50-51), and the cross serves as the final altar. Thus, the enthroned Lamb in Revelation removes the need for temple and altar (Rev 21:22).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 8:20-21; 12:7-8; 22:9-14; 33:20; Exod 20:24-26; Josh 22:10-34; 1 Kgs 18:20-40; Hos 8:11-13; Matt 5:23-24; Heb 13:10-14; Rev 6:9; 8:3-5",

    "content": "Infertility\nWith the apparent exception of Leah—and only then for a time—each of the patriarchs’ wives suffered infertility before eventually having children (Gen 11:30; 25:21; 29:31; see also 1 Sam 1:1-18). Children continued the family line, helped protect the tribe, and provided labor. They ensured that hereditary property would stay within the family, guaranteed assistance in old age, and enacted the proper funeral rites. Infertility was therefore a crushing stigma for a woman (Ps 113:9; Prov 30:15-16; Isa 54:1), who understood herself to be created as a vessel of life (Gen 1:28; 3:20). It was considered a denial of blessing, design, and desire (1:28), and it brought shame (1 Sam 1:7), ridicule (Gen 16:4), and vicious jealousy (30:1).\nIn the Old Testament, childlessness is a theological issue. Fertility is controlled by the Creator (20:17-18; 30:2, 22-23; 1 Sam 1:6, 27), who causes fertility and infertility according to his purpose and his promises (Gen 17:19; 30:2; Ps 113:9; Luke 1:11-20; Rom 4:19). God often chose infertility as a precursor to the birth of a promised or unique child, marking the birth as God’s own work. Childlessness is thus a trial of patience that prompts prayer and faith (Gen 25:21; 1 Sam 1:11). Abraham learned to nurture faith in God’s promise long before his child arrived (Gen 15:4-6; 17:15-21; Rom 4:20-22). When a couple has been infertile, a child’s arrival is marked as a special display of God’s faithfulness and creative authority.\nGod’s delays are not necessarily denials, but they remind longing men and women to use trials for growth and to see children as a gift that cannot be taken for granted. A childless home can be filled with devotion to God as human expectations are submitted to his will. And for whatever reason, a couple may remain infertile their entire lives. God’s people must not isolate their brothers and sisters who are experiencing infertility but must surround them with love and support.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 16:1-6; 17:15-21; 20:17-18; 25:21; 29:31; 30:1-2, 22-24; Exod 23:25-26; Deut 7:12-15; Judg 13:2-5; 1 Sam 1:2-28; 2:5-7; Ps 113:5-9; Isa 54:1-3; Luke 1:5-25; Rom 4:19-22; Gal 4:24-28; Heb 11:11-12",

    "content": "Blessing\nBefore his death, Jacob offered a blessing to each of his sons (49:1-28), as well as to Joseph’s sons (Gen 48:3-20), just as his father Isaac had blessed him (27:27-29). Blessing enables, enhances, and enriches life, whereas a curse diminishes it (Lev 26:14-39). A blessing is issued publicly by a benefactor and provides power for prosperity and success. Blessing is essential to covenant relationships in that it guides and motivates the parties to obey the covenant’s stipulations (Lev 26:3-13). Obedience leads to blessing, whereas rebellion brings a curse (see Deut 28).\nThe initial realm of blessing is creation, in which God as Creator is the ultimate granter of blessing for animals (Gen 1:22) and humans (1:28; see Pss 104; 128:3-4). Humans also serve as channels of divine blessing. Abraham was called to be a blessing to the nations (Gen 12:2-3). The institutions of family (27:27-29), government (1 Kgs 8:14, 52, 66), and religion (Gen 14:19; Lev 9:22) are nurtured, commissioned, and purified through blessing. Israel’s priests mediated God’s blessing to Israel (Num 6:24-26; Deut 10:8).\nThree basic characteristics can be observed in Old Testament blessings: (1) They are conveyed from a greater party to a lesser one (Gen 32:26; Heb 7:6-7); (2) they are signs of favor that result in well-being and productivity (Deut 28:3-7); and (3) they acknowledge that all power and blessing stems from the Creator. All blessings have their source in God’s love (Deut 7:7-8, 12-15).\nGod’s blessings in the Old Testament are in striking contrast with those of the pagan religions of antiquity. For pagan religions, fortunes and fertility of flock, family, and fields came about through sympathetic magic in ceremonial observances at their shrines—profane customs that were designed to manipulate the deities to act on their behalf so that the cycle of life could be maintained. In the Old Testament, all life, fertility, and blessing came by God’s decree, for he is the only true and living God.\nIn the New Testament, the emphasis of blessing shifts from the material to the spiritual, from the nation to the church, and from the temporal to the eternal (Matt 6:25; Eph 1:3; 1 Pet 3:9). In his death, Jesus carried the consequences of sin’s curse (Gal 3:13), established God’s Kingdom (Matt 3:2; 5:3-20; John 3:3-5), and blessed its citizens with forgiveness of sin (Rom 4:6-25). Now believers are called to bless the world (Luke 6:27-28; Rom 12:14; see also Isa 19:24; Zech 8:13).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:22, 28; 9:26-27; 12:2-3; 14:19-20; 24:59-60; 27:1-41; 28:1-4; 32:24-30; 46:1–50:26; Lev 26:3-13; Num 6:22-27; Deut 7:12-15; 10:8; 28:1-14; 33:1-29; 1 Sam 2:20-21; Ps 128:1-6; Matt 5:3-12; Luke 6:27-28; Rom 12:14; Gal 3:13-14; Eph 1:3; Heb 7:6-7; 1 Pet 3:9",

    "content": "Death\nHumans are mortal, and death is the natural end of earthly life (Ps 90:1-6). Human identity began with the earth’s dust being animated by the breath of God (Gen 2:7). This passive state returns at death as God withdraws his breath and the human body collapses again into dust (3:19; Job 4:19-21; Isa 40:6-8). Human life depends entirely and continuously on the Creator of life—his breath is a gift that sustains us in life for as long as he grants it (Ps 104:29).\nDeath entered the human race by sin and brought ruin to it; death comes suddenly, bringing mourning and an apparent end to hopes and dreams. Death is the severest penalty in human justice. In the Old Testament, the death penalty was a punishment for murder (Gen 9:6; Exod 21:12) or blasphemy (Lev 24:16; John 10:30-33)—violations that threatened the living community.\nIn the Old Testament, the opposite of “the land of the living” (Ps 27:13) was Sheol, the realm of the dead that was shrouded in darkness and silence (Job 10:21-22; Ps 94:17; Jon 2:6). Yet even in death, God’s people cannot be separated from his presence (see Prov 14:32). God is sovereign and rules over death (Deut 32:39).\nWhile the Old Testament often speaks of death simply in terms of joining one’s ancestors—without specific reference to resurrection (see, e.g., Gen 49:29-33)—there are some allusions to resurrection (see Job 19:25-27; Isa 25:6-9; 26:19; Dan 12:2). Jewish belief in resurrection seems to have become more widespread during the intertestamental period, and resurrection is a prominent theme in the New Testament. Through Christ, God’s redeemed people will triumph over death (1 Cor 15:54-57), the last enemy to be destroyed (1 Cor 15:26). Death results from sin (Rom 5:12), and those who live in sin and refuse to turn to God will be punished in the lake of fire in what is called the second death (Rev 21:8). But Christ’s death defeated death, and his resurrection serves as the paradigm for all believers (Col 1:18). He is the Lord of the living and of the dead (Rom 14:9). The time of death—when the natural inclination is to mourn—should also be the time of the greatest demonstration of faith, for the recipient of God’s promises has a hope beyond the grave.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 2:15-17; 3:19; 6:17; 9:5-6; 49:29-33; Exod 21:12-17, 28-29; 23:7; 31:14-15; Lev 24:16; Deut 32:39; Job 10:18-22; 19:25-27; Pss 90:1-12; 94:17; Prov 14:32; Eccl 12:1-7; Isa 25:6-9; 26:19; 40:6-8; Dan 12:2-3; Mark 12:26-27; Rom 5:12-17; 1 Cor 15:20-26, 51-58; Rev 20:4-6, 11-15; 21:3-8",

    "content": "Promised Land\nMen and women were given the task of governing the earth and ruling over the creation, both to satisfy their own needs and to bring glory to the Creator (Gen 1:28-30). But when humanity fell into sin, they suffered alienation not only from God and their fellow human beings but also from the land on which they lived (3:17-19; see 4:3-16; cp. 5:29).\nThen God called Abram to follow him by faith and to receive Canaan as a special homeland, a promised land for his descendants as God’s people (12:1-3, 7; 13:14-18; 15:7-21; 17:7-8). Later, after Israel was delivered from Egypt and was established as God’s people at Mount Sinai, they were given possession of the land promised to their fathers.\nContinued possession of the land depended on obedience. If Israel violated the covenant, they would experience the covenant’s curses, the most severe of which is exile from the Promised Land (Lev 26:32-33). Eventually, that is what happened: Israel’s persistent rebellion against the Lord resulted in their exile to Assyria and Babylon, the loss of the land, and the destruction of the Temple (2 Kgs 17:5-23; 25:1-21). But God also promises that when the people repent, “then I will remember my covenant with Jacob . . . and I will remember the land” (Lev 26:42). During the Exile, Jeremiah and other prophets looked beyond the Exile to a future restoration and return to the land (Jer 32:36-44), which occurred during the reign of Cyrus the Great of Persia (see Ezra; Nehemiah).\nThe promises for the land await ultimate fulfillment. God’s purpose is to prepare an eternal homeland for his people, where the rule of the divine King is direct and just, where all things are subject to his will, where death and sin are abolished, and where the needs of his people are completely satisfied (Heb 11:13-16; Rev 21).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:28-30; 3:15-19; 4:3-16; 12:1-3, 7; 13:14-18; 15:1-21; 17:7-8; Exod 6:1-13; Lev 26:1-46; 1 Kgs 8:22-53; 9:1-9; 2 Kgs 17:5-23; 25:1-21; Jer 32:36-44; Heb 11:13-16; Rev 21:1-27",

    "content": "Famine\nFamine occurred early in the lives of Abraham (Gen 12:10) and Isaac (26:1). When famine afflicted Jacob’s family (41:56–42:5), God had already placed Joseph in Egypt to provide for his people through the disaster (45:5, 7). This famine was particularly severe, but famines were not uncommon in the ancient world (see Ruth 1:1; 2 Sam 21:1; 1 Kgs 18:1-2; Hag 1:1-11; Acts 11:28).\nFamine was a devastating catastrophe in an agrarian society. Caused by drought, crop failure, or siege (2 Kgs 25:1-30), it was often accompanied by disease or war that brought adversity at many levels of society (Jer 14:12), including for animals (Joel 1:20). Dependence on rainfall caused some people to stockpile food against possible famine (Gen 41:33-36; 47:23-24; cp. 1 Chr 26:15; 2 Chr 31:11; Neh 10:37-39). Famines had far-reaching results in price inflation, robbery, social exploitation, agricultural collapse, migration, and even cannibalism (Gen 12:10; 26:1; 2 Kgs 6:24-29; Neh 5:1-3; Jer 19:9; Lam 2:20-21; 4:8-10).\nFamine was sometimes a divine judgment on the Israelites (Lev 26:14-20; Deut 11:16-17; 28:33; Jer 29:17-18). Therefore, faithfulness to God was a particularly vivid need (Ps 33:18-19; 37:19), and God’s blessings on the nation included protection from famine (Ezek 34:29; 36:29-30).\nJesus relived Israel’s experience of famine in his own wilderness testing and refused to make bread just for himself (Matt 4:1-4; cp. Deut 8:3). His success showed that scarcity and hunger can develop humility and trust in divine providence. Jesus fed five thousand to draw them to himself as the bread of life, God’s true manna (John 6:32-35), but the crowds followed Jesus more for the food than for who he is (John 6:26-27). Without ignoring physical food, Jesus highlighted spiritual hunger and thirst (Luke 6:21; John 4:34). Eating provides both a context and a metaphor for fellowship (Gen 43:34; Luke 22:15-16; Rev 19:9). Heaven will remove the desperation of hunger altogether (Rev 7:16).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:10; 26:1; 41:33-36, 56-57; 45:6-7; Lev 26:19-20; Deut 8:3; 11:16-17; Ruth 1:1; 2 Sam 21:1; 1 Kgs 18:1-2; 2 Kgs 8:1-2; Jer 14:11-16; Ezek 34:29-31; 36:28-32; Joel 1:1-20; Amos 8:11-14; Hag 1:1-11; Luke 6:21; John 6:32-35; Acts 11:28-30; Rev 7:16",

    "content": "Hardship in Following God\nSometimes people are urged to accept Christ because “he will solve your problems.” But Christ did not promise to solve all of people’s problems. In fact, he repeatedly warned people to consider what it would cost to follow him (see, e.g., Luke 14:28), and he pointed out the hardships that would come into their lives as a result of choosing to follow him (see, e.g., Mark 8:34).\nExodus 5 gives us a case study: Pharaoh’s earlier enslavement and persecution of the Hebrews was purely strategic. He worried that this growing sector of the population would cause trouble for him (Exod 1:8-22). In chapter 5, the situation is different. Moses and Aaron had rallied the people’s hopes that their God would soon rescue them (4:29-31). During their initial encounter with Pharaoh, Moses and Aaron confronted him with the reality of God’s sovereign rule (5:1-3). Not surprisingly, Pharaoh considered this an affront to his own sovereignty and reacted strongly against the Israelites (5:4-21).\nWhen God’s Kingdom clashes with God’s enemies, there is often conflict and hardship for God’s people. We should not be surprised. Believers have changed allegiance from the realm of darkness to the realm of light (Col 1:11-14), and those who rule in the realm of darkness will certainly not let us leave their power without a fight. We must stand firm in our faith, knowing that God will secure the final victory on our behalf (Exod 6:1-8; see also Matt 5:11-12; John 16:33; Rom 16:20; Eph 6:10-18).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 39:6-20; Exod 5:1-23; 18:8; 1 Kgs 18:3-4; 19:1-10; Pss 6:6-7; 22:11-18; Matt 5:11-12; Mark 8:34; John 15:20; 16:33; Rom 16:20; 2 Cor 11:23-29; Eph 6:10-18; 2 Tim 3:12; Heb 10:32-36; 1 Pet 1:6-7; 3:9-17; 4:12-19",

    "content": "Hardened Hearts\nExodus repeatedly states that the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart (Exod 4:21; 9:12; 10:1, 20; 11:10; 14:4, 8). These statements can be troubling. Was Pharaoh forced to sin against God?\nOther factors need to be taken into account: (1) The Lord knew ahead of time that Pharaoh would harden his heart (3:19); (2) Pharaoh himself became stubborn (8:15, 32); and (3) Pharaoh remained stubborn despite clear warnings (8:19). Pharaoh was not a well-meaning, misguided individual who was not allowed to repent. Although God was ultimately in control of Pharaoh, Pharaoh himself was accountable for his actions.\nThis interplay between human choice and divine sovereignty is found in other places in Scripture. The Israelites hardened their hearts and refused to believe God in the wilderness (Ps 95:8-10). God hardened the hearts of the Canaanites so that they did not seek to make peace with the Hebrews (Josh 11:20). The message God gave to Isaiah hardened the hearts of his hearers (Isa 6:9-10); similarly in the New Testament, many people hardened their hearts in response to the message of the gospel (Matt 13:15; John 12:40; Acts 28:27). People are responsible for their choices, but no one makes choices in a vacuum. Rather, they make them in the context of how God has made his world and providentially directs it.\nThe emphasis in Exodus on God’s control of Pharaoh puts the conflict between two belief systems into stark contrast. Pharaoh believed that he was sovereign and divine, able to do whatever he pleased. God demonstrated that this was not the case: Pharaoh was dependent, as much the prisoner of his choices as any other creature on the planet. There is only one absolutely independent “I Am,” and that is Yahweh, the Lord (see 3:6-14; 6:2-8; 20:2; 34:6-7; Isa 45:3-7; 48:17; Mark 14:62; John 8:23-28).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 8:21; Exod 3:19; 4:21; 8:15, 19, 32; 9:12; 10:1, 20; 11:10; 14:4, 8; Josh 11:19-20; 2 Chr 36:11-13; Ps 95:8-11; Isa 6:9-10; Ezek 11:18-21; 36:22-27; Matt 12:34-35; 13:10-17; Luke 8:4-15; John 12:37-40; Acts 28:23-28; Rom 2:14-16; 11:7-12; 2 Cor 3:13-18; Eph 4:17-24; Heb 3:6-19; 6:4-8",

    "content": "The Exodus as History\nIsrael’s understanding of reality was radically different from that of all other ancient cultures. All of the other major cultures surrounding Israel—from Sumer in southern Mesopotamia in 2000 BC to Rome in AD 200—reached their view of reality by observing nature. They concluded that there were many gods and that all events go in unending cycles. Ancient Israel, by contrast, believed that there is one God who is distinct from the world, who made the world with purpose, and who is guiding its events to realize his purposes. How did the Israelites come to their unique concept of reality? Was it not through encounters with the true God in actual events of history? The most reasonable explanation for the distinctiveness of Israel’s understanding is that, as the Bible describes, God broke into their experience and showed himself to them in events that have been recorded as history.\nThere is no report in Egyptian texts of the events the Bible describes, which has raised suspicions for many. But it would have been highly unusual at that time for a world power to report on their defeat at the hands of a group of slaves. The Bible’s historical reporting, with its inclusion of stories of Israel’s own disasters, is unlike anything else found in the ancient Near East.\nArchaeology cannot prove that certain events happened, but it can demonstrate that conditions would have permitted the events to occur, and that is true of the book of Exodus and of the Bible in general. Egyptian records and archaeology neither confirm nor contradict the Bible’s record. However, the text of Exodus shows an intimate familiarity with Egyptian thought and culture, just as a historical record would.\nThe writers of the Bible believed they were reporting actual events, and they expected their readers to understand them as such. Exodus 18:8-12 gives the first example of someone who put his faith in God because of a testimony to what had actually happened. Faith in God and in his inspired word, the Bible, has a strong historical basis. God has entered into history to act for the salvation of humanity. His acts include Israel’s exodus from Egypt and climax in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 14:15–15:21; 18:8-12; Judg 11:12-27; Acts 7:1-56",

    "content": "The Purpose of the Sinai Covenant\nNearly everything the Israelites had learned about ultimate reality from the Egyptians was wrong. There are not many gods; there is only one God. The Creator is perfectly good, and evil is the result of rebellion against him. God’s blessings cannot be obtained through magic and manipulation; instead, they are free to those who lovingly submit to him.\nUpon leaving Egypt, the Israelites did not yet know God in the way that he intended. In the plagues and the Red Sea crossing, they learned of God’s unique power. In the wilderness, they learned about God’s providential care. But they still did not know God’s character. The covenant at Sinai was designed to teach the Israelites about God’s nature and character as they lived out his Torah, his instructions.\nThe covenant used a familiar political form, the suzerain-vassal treaty, in which a great king (the suzerain) made a treaty with a nation he had subjected as a vassal people. In such a treaty, the conquered people would declare their absolute loyalty to the king and obedience to his demands. The king, for his part, would promise to care for the conquered people and protect them from any enemies who might attack them. In the covenant at Sinai, God called the people to absolute loyalty to himself as the only God and to a life that reflected his will and nature as their sovereign Creator.\nGod wanted a very simple and straightforward response of obedience from the Israelites. But ever since the Fall (Gen 3), there has been something fundamentally wrong with the human spirit. Simple obedience was thus impossible for the Israelites, whose hearts were unchanged. The covenant was a good thing, but it was weak in that it was incapable of making the Israelites able to follow it (Rom 7:12; 8:3). Unless God graciously bestows his Spirit upon us, we will never be able to do the things we must do; we will never share the character of the Creator. Now, through the cross of Christ, God has made it possible for us to be empowered by the Spirit and thus to fulfill his covenant purpose by sharing his holy character.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 9:1; 19:3-6; Lev 11:44-45; Jer 31:33-34; 32:40; John 16:5-11; Rom 8:5-14; 10:8-17; Gal 5",

    "content": "Ancient Law Codes\nUntil the late 1800s, the law of Moses was believed to be a unique code of law, existing nearly a thousand years before anything comparable in Greek and Roman laws. Excavations in Persia in the late 1800s, however, uncovered laws set forth by the Babylonian king Hammurabi in the 1700s BC, some 300 years prior to Moses. Surprisingly, a number of the laws in that list are almost identical to those in the Bible. Though this seemed to imply that the biblical laws had been taken from Hammurabi, subsequent discoveries produced law codes preceding Hammurabi’s by at least 500 years, and several laws are common to all of them, so Hammurabi also did not originate them.\nWhat does this mean for the Bible? First, it is not surprising that we find similar laws from cultures neighboring Israel; similar societies require similar codes of conduct in order to ensure justice. Second, the biblical laws are unique in that they are incorporated in a covenant with God. Elsewhere in the ancient Near East, religious laws (about sacrifice, prayers, offerings, etc.) and civil laws (covering theft, lying, sexual conduct, murder, etc.) were completely unrelated because ethics and religion were considered separate domains. Religion was a matter of prayer, devotion, offerings, and ritual behavior—the territory of priests. Ethics concerned social and civil behavior—the business of the king. The biblical view of things is different: God is sovereign over both religion and society. So a person who is in a relationship with the true God must not only participate in proper worship (religion) but also treat other people rightly (ethics).\nIsrael’s covenant with God made use of existing forms but invested them with new meaning. For example, the basic layout of Israel’s Tabernacle (Exod 26–27) and Temple (see 1 Kgs 6:1–7:51) were the same as elsewhere in the ancient world, and the basic forms of the Hebrew sacrifices (see Lev 1–7) were largely identical to the forms of pagan sacrifices. But the meaning and purpose of the Temple and the sacrifices were significantly different from the meaning and purpose of such things in paganism (see study notes on Exod 20:3-17; 25:1–40:38; Lev 1:1–7:38).\nWhile many of the laws of Moses were not new to the world at that time, the idea that the behavior they called for is written into the very fabric of the universe by its Creator was radically new.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 20:1–23:33; 34:1–35:3; Lev 1:1–27:34; Deut 4:1–33:29; Ezra 1:1-4; Esth 1:13-19; 8:9-14; Dan 6:6-9; Luke 2:1-3",

    "content": "The Glory of God\nGlory has a rather different connotation in the Old Testament than it does in English usage. The English word suggests something thin and passing—the glory of a sunset, the glory of last year’s winning team. The root idea of the Hebrew word for glory is “heaviness” or “solidity.” It connotes “significance” or “worth,” the absolute opposite of “vanity” or “nothingness.” When God’s glory appears, it is not merely a bright light or a glittering cloud, but a visible expression of his absolute reality.\nGod’s glory is the manifestation of his person, his power, and his majesty (see Ezek 1:28; 10:4). God’s glory may be revealed in nature, such as in a thunderstorm (Job 37:2-5; Ps 29:3, 7) or in the plagues sent on the Egyptians (Num 14:21-22). God’s glory can also be a unique manifestation, such as the revelation on Mount Sinai (Deut 5:24). When the Tabernacle and Solomon’s Temple were dedicated, God’s glory filled those structures (Exod 40:34-35; 1 Kgs 8:10-11), indicating his approval of them and that his presence would now reside there. Similarly, the glory of the Lord sent the fire that kindled the first sacrifices of the sanctuary (Lev 9:22-24).\nWhen God reveals his glory to his creation (see, e.g., Exod 24:16-18), it is often called a theophany. God gives limited (or veiled) glimpses of his glory because no one can see God and live (Exod 33:18-23; see also Isa 6:5). To “give glory” to God (Josh 7:19; Isa 24:15; Jer 13:16) means to speak or act in a manner that acknowledges who God is.\nChrist is the glory and image of God (2 Cor 4:4), and he was glorified in his death and resurrection (John 17:1-5). When Christ appears again at last, he will further manifest God’s glory in his restored Kingdom (Rev 21:11, 23). Paul declares that the presence of Christ in the lives of believers provides assurance that we will share in that glory (Rom 5:2; Col 1:27).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 14:17-18; 16:6-12; 33:17-23; 40:34-38; Lev 9:23-24; 10:1-3; Num 14:21-22; Deut 5:24; Josh 7:19; 1 Kgs 8:11; 2 Chr 7:1-3; Job 37:2-5; Pss 3:3; 8:4-6; 19:1; 29:3, 7-9; 48:8; Isa 6:3-5; 42:8; 43:7; 66:18-19; Jer 13:16; Ezek 1:28; 10:4; Hos 4:7; John 17:1-5; Rom 5:2; 2 Cor 4:4; Col 1:27; Rev 21:10-11, 23-25",

    "content": "The Plagues\nRescuing the Hebrew people from oppression by the Egyptians was not the main purpose of the plagues. If that had been the case, one climactic miracle would have been sufficient. The real purpose of the plagues was to communicate who God is—to Israel, to Egypt, and to the surrounding nations.\nThe Israelites had likely lost sight of who God was. They had lived for hundreds of years in Egypt, one of the most polytheistic cultures the world has ever known. Whatever the Israelites may have believed about God when they arrived in Egypt, they were certainly infected with the prevailing pagan views during their sojourn there (see Exod 32).\nThe plagues revealed the Lord’s absolute superiority over everything in creation. These cataclysmic events were specifically aimed at elements the Egyptians revered and worshiped:\n1. The Nile Turned to Blood (7:14-25): The Nile, revered as a god who gave Egypt life and fertility, became a bloody representation of death.\n2. Frogs (8:1-15): The Egyptians revered frogs (represented by Heqet, frog-headed goddess of fruitfulness) as having the key of life beyond death. Now frogs filled the land with the stink of death.\n3. Gnats (8:16-19): The “finger of God” fell on the land with a plague of biting insects that came from the earth, revealing God’s power over Geb, the Egyptian god of the earth.\n4. Flies (8:20-32): The Lord made “a clear distinction” between Israel and Egypt when swarms of biting flies (revered as embodying life from death) filled the land and tormented the Egyptians, including Pharaoh.\n5. Death of Livestock (9:1-7): The Egyptians revered cattle as divine, having the power of life and fertility; Amon-Re, the chief god of Egypt, was pictured as a bull. The “hand of the Lord” struck them, demonstrating his sovereign power.\n6. Festering Boils (9:8-12): God struck the Egyptians with this plague of burning sores, which the Egyptian goddess of healing, Sekhmet, was evidently powerless to ameliorate.\n7. Hail (9:13-35): The Egyptian god Osiris, who represented vegetation, was unable to prevent the Lord from destroying it, because “the earth belongs to the Lord.”\n8. Locusts (10:1-20): The Lord directed the wind and sent locusts to destroy the last of the vegetation, and with it any hope in Osiris to restore Egypt’s crops.\n9. Darkness (10:21-29): The Lord demonstrated complete, sovereign control over Re, the sun god and king of the Egyptian gods, considered the father of mankind. No power in Egypt could stand against the Lord and his purposes.\n10. Death of the Firstborn (11:1–12:30): The Lord took away life itself—which the Egyptians revered above all else—from the heir of every family in Egypt, while preserving and rescuing Israel through the blood sacrifice of the Lord’s Passover.\nThus Yahweh demonstrated to both the Egyptians and the Israelites that he alone is God.\nThe plagues are often referred to as “signs,” just as Jesus’ miracles were (e.g., 7:3; 10:1-2; John 2:23; 4:48; 12:37). The plagues show that worshiping created things brings God’s judgment. Jesus’ miracles, on the other hand, show that all that is deadly in creation—illness, the demonic, nature run amok, and even death itself—can be overcome by God’s gift of life.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:15-20; 20:1-18; Exod 7:3-5; 7:14–11:1012:28-33; 32:35; Num 11:33; 12:1-15; 16:43-50; 1 Kgs 13:4; 2 Kgs 2:24; 2 Chr 26:16-21; Acts 5:1-11",

    "content": "The Passover\nThe festival of Passover became a central feature of Israelite religious practice. This festival, which celebrated God’s deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt and his sparing of them from the final, deadly plague, was to be commemorated on an annual basis, in accorance with the instructions given in Exodus (Exod 12:1-27). Passover was to serve as a reminder across the generations of God’s saving activity. As such, it was an enacted, participatory festival, in which the people ate only unleavened bread, just as they had done in their hurried departure from Egypt.\nIn that first Passover, a lamb was sacrificed that took the place of the firstborn son of every family of Israel (Exod 12:12-13, 23). Passover thus carries the notion that we can be delivered from death only by means of a sacrifice that takes our place. But while Passover marked an event of tremendous significance in Israelite history, the events of the Exodus did not conquer the universal, fundamental problem of death, a problem that stems from sin (1 Cor 15:56).\nMany years later, around the time of the Passover festival, Jesus Christ gave his life as “a ransom for many” (Matt 20:28; Mark 10:45) and became “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). While sharing a final Passover meal with his disciples, Jesus spoke of the symbolic nature of the wine they shared: “This is my blood, which confirms the covenant. . . . It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many” (Matt 26:28). He embodies and enacts a new Passover: Through his sacrifice, sin and death were fully and finally defeated (see also Isa 25:7-8).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 12:1-51; Lev 23:4-8; Num 9:1-14; 28:16-25; Deut 16:1-7; Matt 26:17-30; Luke 22:15-20; 1 Cor 5:6-8",

    "content": "The Tabernacle\nFrom the very beginning of creation, God’s plan was to share his life with humanity and allow people to enjoy fellowship with him. However, the entry of sin into the world (Gen 3) created a serious obstacle, for if sinful people were to come into the presence of God, his holiness would destroy them. The Tabernacle provided a temporary means by which the Israelites could enjoy God’s presence without being destroyed by it (Exod 25:8). The Tabernacle was a mobile sanctuary where God dwelled with his people and was the place where Israel made sacrifices and offerings in worship of the Lord.\nThe Tabernacle shows us in tangible ways what is required to enter God’s presence. The altar shows us that sin must be removed through a sacrificial death. The washbasin shows that fellowship with God demands removing uncleanness, that is, anything that conflicts with God’s ethical perfection. In the Holy Place, the lampstand and the table show that we must walk in God’s light and rely on him to provide for our needs. The incense altar represents prayer, and the constantly rising incense reminds those who are forgiven and washed, who are walking in his light and relying constantly on him, that they have unlimited access to him. The curtain between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place reminds us that the Almighty, the holy God who invites us into fellowship, cannot be approached casually. Behind the curtain is the glorious Ark of the Covenant, over which God’s glory appeared, symbolizing his enthronement as Israel’s king. The centrality of the Ark reflects God’s central purpose for his people—a covenant relationship with the living God.\nOur new covenant relationship with God is made possible by Jesus’ perfect sacrifice for sin and his ministry as our high priest before God (see especially Heb 9–10). He has fulfilled the requirements that are illustrated by the ancient Tabernacle, and we can now approach God’s throne with boldness and confidence (see Eph 3:12; Heb 4:14-16).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 25:1-9; 26:1-37; 35:4–36:38; 38:21-31; 39:32–40:35; 2 Chr 3:1–7:22; Heb 9:1-28",

    "content": "Community Identity\nIn modern Western society, the individual is considered to be the primary social entity. In Israel, by contrast, an individual’s identity and significance were determined by his or her membership in the community. All Israelites were expected to partake of the common identity of the community as the “children of Israel” and to embody the characteristics that marked the whole.\nIn the Old Testament, the people are often referred to or addressed in the singular, emphasizing their oneness. The Decalogue (Exod 20:2-17) and the blessing of Aaron (Num 6:24-26), for example, are given in the singular. The individual could often represent the group, and the group could be referred to as an individual. Nehemiah, for example, asks forgiveness for the sins that caused the exile to Babylon as though he had been one of those transgressors (“we have sinned,” Neh 1:6-7). Nehemiah was governor of Judea from 445 to 433 BC, about 140 years after the destruction of Jerusalem (586 BC), so he did not participate in the sins leading to the Exile. Yet in his prayer, he identifies with his people in their sinfulness. In this same way, the high priest could represent the entire people on the Day of Atonement (see Lev 16). Because the individual Israelite was so strongly identified with the community, the sin of the individual would become the sin of the community if not addressed (see Lev 4:3-21; 20:1-5).\nIn like manner, the Christian community is described as the “body of Christ” (1 Cor 12:27; Eph 4:12). The members partake of Christ’s identity through the Holy Spirit. That is, as the body of Christ they manifest Christ’s life in their lives, and as a unified whole they reveal him to the world. Paul exhorts the Galatians to share the burdens of others (Gal 6:2) and so to model Christ’s example (Matt 11:28-30).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 20:5-6, 8-10; Lev 4:3-21; 20:1-5; Josh 7:1-26; Neh 1:6-7; 1 Cor 12:12-27; Gal 6:2; Eph 4:11-13",

    "content": "God’s Instructions\nThe common Hebrew word torah is translated “law” in most English versions. This translation comes from the use of the Greek word nomos (which means “law”) to translate torah in the Septuagint (the Greek Old Testament). However, torah is better understood as “teaching,” “instruction,” or “doctrine.”\nThe term law often brings to mind an authority imposed by an external force (such as a government) and is often perceived as harsh and unbending. The torah of Moses, however, is instructional. It might embody law, but it also included stories (Lev 10:1-3), poetry (Deut 32:1-43), genealogies (Exod 6:14-25), and a number of other literary forms.\nThere are other words properly translated “law,” and these are included within the body of instruction given to the Israelites. For example, khoq, meaning “statute,” refers to a law as it was given by the lawgiver—in this case, by God himself (e.g., Lev 6:22). It states a general principle, leaving its application open to interpretation by context or the courts. In Leviticus 18:4-5 and 19:37, khuqqah (“decrees”) is paired with mishpatim (“regulations”), a term indicating case laws. It would be impossible to write laws that cover every situation. A case law, therefore, refers to a court’s previous interpretation of a statute in certain cases; the court’s decisions in the past give guidance for deciding on similar cases in the present.\nLaw is necessary, for there will always be people who need its restraint. And much of the content in the Torah can properly be described as “law.” But in a more general sense, the Torah allows God’s people to be instructed in who he is and who they are to be in light of that. Similarly, instruction in doctrine and godly living are an integral part of the church and its life-giving message to the world (Col 3:16).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 26:5; Exod 16:4; Lev 6:9, 14; Deut 17:8-13, 18-20; 2 Kgs 10:30-31; 22:8-20; Job 22:21-23; Pss 40:8; 78:9-12; Prov 6:20-23; 13:14; 28:9; Isa 8:20; Col 3:16; 2 Tim 3:14-17",

    "content": "God’s Absolute Holiness\nHoliness is the fundamental descriptor of who God is. It is not merely one of his many attributes; it is the key to his very being. Calling God “the Holy One” speaks to the transcendence of his nature, in sharp contrast to the finite creation, whose creatures are bound by time and space. God speaks of himself as “I Am Who I Am” (Exod 3:14), defining himself by himself. God is the Wholly Other, the One who is completely self-sufficient and distinct from the created order.\nGod’s holiness also speaks of his character. It is common to describe God’s holiness in terms of his separation from sin and his wrath against it, but the notion of holiness embraces all of God’s character, including his mercy. God revealed himself to Moses as the “God of compassion and mercy.” He said, “I am slow to anger and filled with unfailing love and faithfulness.” In his holiness, God shows this “unfailing love to a thousand generations. I forgive iniquity, rebellion, and sin. But I do not excuse the guilty” (Exod 34:6-7).\nGod’s holiness can be deadly to uninvited intruders (Isa 6:3, 5; see Exod 28:35) or to those who treat it with contempt. His infinite holiness is too much for finite, fallen mortals and would utterly destroy them apart from God’s mercy. Understanding God’s holiness should thus trigger a response of awe and reverence. Anything less would be profane. Perhaps this was the error that cost Nadab and Abihu their lives (Lev 10:1-3). Only in recognizing the awesomeness of God can we appreciate his great love for us and worship him appropriately and authentically.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 3:14; 34:6-7; Lev 10:3; Lev 11:44-45; 1 Sam 2:1-2; Isa 6:3-5; 52:10; Hos 11:9",

    "content": "Clean, Unclean, and Holy\nThe rites and regulations establishing cleanness and uncleanness were to distinguish Israel from the surrounding nations. To understand a rationale behind these regulations, one suggestion has been that unclean things are associated with death or the ground (see, e.g., Lev 21:1, 11; 22:8). Recent studies, however, suggest the principle of “normalcy.” God is a God of order. Things that are normal in God’s order are called “clean” and are “permitted.” Abnormal things would be unfit for food or offerings and would be “unclean.” A normal land animal would be a vegetarian (see Gen 1:30). A normal human body would have no infections or discharges. A normal piece of cloth would have no mildew on it. If abnormalities occurred, the animal, person, or cloth was unclean.\nWhat is unclean is not sinful but represents a kind of unworthiness that cannot come in contact with what is holy (e.g., Lev 11:44-45). If it is cleansed, it acquires the potential for holiness; it may be dedicated to God and become holy. If what is holy (such as the Sabbath) is treated like something common, God is blasphemed and the thing is profaned. If what is clean becomes unclean, it is defiled and requires cleansing. Some things, such as unclean animals, fish, or birds, remain unclean by definition and can never be cleansed, and, thus, can never become holy.\nIn the new covenant, things that were previously unclean have been declared clean (Acts 10:15, 28, 45). Yet God is still a God of order (1 Cor 14:33) and wants worship to be conducted in an orderly way (1 Cor 14:40). While God’s grace is abundant to repentant sinners, some things are still repulsive to his holiness and should never be brought into his presence (e.g., Ananias and Sapphira’s offering; see Acts 5:1-11).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 7:2; Lev 11:1–15:33; 21:1-23; 22:3-8; Num 19:1-22; Deut 14:1-21; 21:1-9; Pss 19:9; 24:3-4; 51:7-10; Isa 52:11; Matt 8:2-4; John 13:10-11; Acts 10:9-28; Heb 9:13-15, 23",

    "content": "Holiness by Relationship\nHoliness refers to God’s transcendent character (Lev 10:3). How can we, finite creatures who have fallen into sin, be holy as God is holy?\nWe can never become transcendent like God. We will always be finite creatures, and our holiness cannot be absolute the way God’s holiness is. Thus our holiness does not refer to our own nature and character. Instead, it refers to our relationship with God.\nWhen God declares a place to be holy, it is because he manifests himself there (see Exod 3:5); if his presence is withdrawn, the place reverts to being ordinary. When God declares an object to be holy, such as an altar (Exod 29:44-46), it is because it was built in the manner prescribed by God and has been accepted by God for his service. Its relationship to God makes it holy as nothing else could.\nIt is the same for people. We are told to be holy because God is holy (Lev 19:2; 1 Pet 1:15-16). Such holiness can only be imputed to humans. Without a relationship with God, true holiness remains elusive, no matter how good, pious, or disciplined a person’s life might be. Only God can make people holy (Exod 31:13; Lev 20:8; 22:32). God promises to be with his people and make their holiness possible (Hos 11:9; see Isa 35:8-10).\nThe church, like Israel of the Old Testament, shares a relationship with God. Our adoption as God’s children allows us to become godly people (see Exod 4:22; Rom 8:14; Gal 3:26; 1 Jn 3:2). The atoning death of Jesus, the Holy One, makes it possible for all who call on him by faith to enjoy a right relationship with him (Rom 5:12-21), which serves as the basis of our holiness (see 1 Cor 6:11). We can be holy in our standing with God as well as in our conduct toward other people—but only through our connection to the holy God.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 3:5; 20:8-11; 28:29-35; 29:44-46; 31:13; Lev 11:44-45; 19:1-3; 20:3-8; 22:32; Ps 24:3-6; Isa 35:8-10; Dan 4:8-9; Rom 8:5-14; Gal 3:2-3; 5:16-26; 1 Pet 1:13-16; 1 Jn 3:2-3",

    "content": "Atonement\nLeviticus 16 describes the Day of Atonement. On this day, the high priest presented the sins of the community to the Lord. Worshiping a holy God requires atonement, the removal of any uncleanness or sin that stands in the way. God’s grace permitted the death of an animal to be accepted in exchange for the sinner’s life. In the atoning offerings, the sacrifice represented the life of the worshiper: The animal was sacrificed so that the worshiper might live. God designated the blood of the sacrifice—blood represents life—as the means of atonement (Lev 17:11).\nAtonement provides both expiation and propitiation. Expiation is the payment of what is owed. For example, the guilt offering (5:14–6:7) involves damages or loss to property, and the loss must be repaid with a 20 percent surcharge. Propitiation, on the other hand, involves appeasing or pacifying an offended party. For example, the whole burnt offering (1:1-17) and the sin offering (4:1–5:13) require no discernable payment of a debt.\nIn the atoning sacrifices, the act of laying hands on the victim (4:4-35; 16:21) indicates identification of the worshiper with the animal being sacrificed. The blood, representing the life of the animal (17:14), is presented in place of the life of the worshiper (17:11). The animal is killed, and its blood and certain parts are ceremonially presented to God, thus cleansing the worshiper and averting God’s wrath.\nThe blood of Jesus brings atonement (Eph 1:7; Col 1:20) and obtains eternal redemption for believers (Heb 9:12). Christ, God’s lamb, reconciles us to God (John 1:29; Heb 9:14). He paid our debt of sin (expiation) and satisfied God’s judgment against us (propitiation).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 25:17-22; 30:10-16; Lev 1:1-17; 4:1–6:7; 16:1-34; 17:10-14; 23:26-32; Num 15:22-29; 29:7-11; Ps 51:7; Prov 16:6; Ezek 43:18-27; Dan 9:24; John 1:29; Eph 1:7; Col 1:20; Heb 2:16-17; 9:12-14",

    "content": "Family, Community, and Sexual Sin\nIn Israel, the family was the basic building block for the solidarity of the entire people. Each of the twelve tribes was a conglomeration of families and clans. The twelve tribes together comprised the people of Israel as a whole. Although the level of solidarity might decrease at a distance from one’s immediate family, this familial notion permeated all of Israelite society. A kinsman was often called a brother, not just a relative, to express the close intimacy. By extension of the family model, the term often translated “brother” could also be used of a fellow Israelite (see Deut 1:16, “fellow Israelites”; Deut 3:18, “Israelite relatives”).\nSince Israel was seen as an extended family, its existence depended on the integrity of the home. Crimes such as incest and adultery were punished very severely because they weakened the foundation of the family. Incest introduced competition, threatening the safety of the home by violating the trust, intimacy, and sense of belonging shared by its members. Adultery fragmented the home by allowing intimacy with someone outside it to divide the loyalties of its participants. These powerful enemies of family solidarity weakened the clan and tribe (see Lev 18:6-23) and, by extension, the solidarity of the nation itself.\nSexual sins—even those that are consensual—are not “victimless crimes” but sins that eventually threaten the community itself. The importance given in Old Testament law to such crimes is echoed in New Testament warnings against sexual immorality (see especially 1 Cor 5:1-2; 6:13-20; 7:2; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:3; Jude 1:7; Rev 2:14-16, 20).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 19:30-38; 49:3-4; Lev 18:6-30; 20:14, 21; 2 Sam 13:1-39; Matt 14:3-5; 1 Cor 5:1-2; 6:13-20; 7:2; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:3; Jude 1:7; Rev 2:14-16, 20",

    "content": "Concern for the Poor\nGod commanded Israel to show concern for its people’s well-being. Israel’s covenant with God, together with its self-concept as an extended family, exerted a leveling effect that resisted pretensions to privilege. A family should provide for members who are facing difficulty. These members of the Israelite people included widows and orphans (Exod 22:22), the poor, and foreigners (Lev 19:10). The edges of the fields and the gleanings of field and vineyard were to be left for the needy (see Lev 23:22). Those who were destitute were not to be victimized. Instead, loans were to be made without interest, or the debtor was to be allowed to work off his debt with dignity as a bondservant (25:35-42). These positive steps ensured that the poor had food to eat.\nThe Bible first mentions concern for the poor in the radical accommodations of the offering system to those unable to afford more costly offerings. Birds could be substituted for lambs in the whole burnt offering (1:14-17) and the sin offering (5:7-10), and there were other such concessions in the cleansing rituals (14:21-22). Perhaps the most striking is in the substitution of flour for the sin offering (5:11-13). The life-for-a-life symbolism is forfeited for economic reasons, showing clearly God’s desire that the poor who cannot afford a lamb should nonetheless be able to experience forgiveness of sins.\nThis theme is continued in the prophets’ concern for the poor and helpless and their pleas for social justice and compassion (e.g., Isa 1:17; Amos 2:6). The prophets had some strong words for those responsible for oppressing the needy (see e.g., 4:1-3; 8:4-8). The worship practices of the people—no matter how lavish—were not accepted by God if, at the same time, those worshiping were guilty of injustice and oppression (see Isa 1:15-20; Mic 6:6-8). This notion that proper attitudes and actions toward God and others are more important than the practice of worship rituals is reflected in the story in the Gospels of the poor widow’s offering. Her offering receives praise from Jesus, not because of its monetary value, but because of the devotion it represented (Mark 12:41-44). Religious practices could even inhibit helping those in need (see Mark 7:9-13).\nBoth Jesus and the early church exhibited concern for the poor. Jesus indicated that a major component of his mission was to bring hope to the poor and release for the oppressed (Luke 4:16-21). He warned strongly against neglecting the poor (Luke 16:19-31) and indicated that a willingness to provide for the poor was necessary for those desiring to be his followers (see Luke 18:18-23). Reflecting the teaching of Christ, the early church sought to ensure that the needy among them were well cared for (Acts 2:44-45; Acts 4:32-37; 1 Tim 5:3-16). As in the prophets, the mistreatment of the marginalized made a farce of religious practice (1 Cor 11:17-29; Jas 1:27–2:17).\nGod’s concern for the poor is thus a theme that runs throughout Scripture, and believers must take up a similar perspective toward those in need.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 22:22-27; 23:6-11; Lev 5:7, 11; 14:21-22; 19:9-10; 23:22; Deut 10:17-19; 15:4-11; 16:9-12; 24:6-22; 26:12-13; 27:17-19; 1 Sam 2:8; Ps 10:13-18; 35:10; 68:5; Prov 14:31; Isa 1:15-17; Amos 2:6; 4:1; 8:4-7; Mic 6:6-8, 12; Mark 12:41-44; Luke 6:20; 14:12-14; Jas 2:1-17",

    "content": "Complete Dedication\nThe Hebrew word kherem (“specially set apart”) is difficult to translate because it represents a concept for which there is no exact parallel in modern English. In the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, kherem designated something that was dedicated to a pagan god and therefore hostile to the Lord. Such things were to be destroyed (see Josh 6:18). In the case of valuable metal items, they were brought to the sanctuary, where they became holy to the Lord (Lev 27:28; see also Josh 6:19, 24). The concept of being “specially set apart” was also applied to Israel’s enemies when they and their property were destroyed (Josh 6:17-19; 1 Sam 15:2-3).\nIn Leviticus 27:21, 28, kherem indicates an acceptable vow devoting something to the Lord for use in the sanctuary (see Num 18:14). This made the item, land, or person holy. The thing or person could not be bought back; it remained in the Lord’s service permanently.\nThe concept of complete dedication through total destruction underlies several passages in the apostle Paul’s writings. In Romans 9:3, Paul was even willing to be declared anathema (the Greek equivalent of kherem) if it would bring about the salvation of his fellow Jews. In Galatians 1:8-9, the same Greek word indicates an appropriate end for those who preach a false gospel. In 1 Corinthians 12:3, Paul warns that no one speaking in the Spirit can call Jesus anathema, that is, no one who has God’s Spirit will interpret Jesus’ crucifixion as a sign of God’s rejection of him, as the Jews of Paul’s day did. Instead, they will recognize it as an act of atonement for sinful humanity.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 22:20; Lev 27:28-29; Num 18:8-14; 21:2-3; Deut 7:1-6, 26; 13:12-18; Josh 6:17-19, 24; 7:11-15; 1 Sam 15:2-3; 1 Kgs 20:42; Isa 43:26-28; Mal 4:5-6; Rom 9:3; 1 Cor 16:22; Gal 1:8-9",

    "content": "The Priestly Blessing\nThe priestly blessing (Num 6:22-27) is one of the most familiar and best-loved passages in the Hebrew Bible. Through the centuries, worshipers have found comfort in its brief but profound lines. This famous text is simple and elegant.\nThe priestly blessing invokes the Lord’s blessing by repeating his name in each appeal (“the Lord” = Yahweh; see study note on Exod 3:15). The repetition of God’s name reminds God’s people of his interest and involvement in their lives. This benediction emphasizes the relationship between God and his people and helps them to remember the source of their blessings.\nMany Old Testament passages refer to blessings pronounced by God and by people (e.g., Gen 12:1-3; 27:1-40; Deut 7:12-15; 28:1-14). The Israelites needed God’s blessings—his help and favor—as they prepared to leave Sinai. Although the modern reader tends to think of a blessing in general terms, the Israelites in the wilderness must have understood it in terms of food, water, health, children, protection from enemies, and settlement in the Promised Land. Throughout the book of Numbers, God dealt with Israel through these down-to-earth concerns.\nThe Lord blessed Israel through the good words of Aaron and his sons, the priests (Num 6:22-23). In addition to their work in the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), the priests played an important role in Israelite life. For example, the priests helped administer justice in the land (Deut 17:8-12) and assisted the king in his duties, according to a principle established in Deut 17:18-20. Eli the priest comforted Hannah and took an active role in the spiritual formation of young Samuel (1 Sam 1:1–3:21). The priests and Levites were active in Israel’s spiritual instruction (see, e.g., Deut 33:9-10; Neh 8:9-12; Mal 2:5-9).\nAn important archaeological discovery draws attention to the significance of this ancient priestly blessing. In 1980, excavators recovered two small silver scrolls from a rock-cut tomb at Ketef Hinnom, southwest of the Old City of Jerusalem. Scholars date these small amulets to the late 600s or early 500s BC. When these delicate scrolls were unrolled through a lengthy and tedious process, they were found to contain the blessing from Num 6:24-26 in words that are very close to the text in the Hebrew Bible. In ancient times, such scrolls were sometimes worn as charms, similar in function to the tefillin, or “phylacteries” or “prayer boxes” (see Deut 6:8; Matt 23:5). These small scrolls are the earliest manuscripts of the biblical text and contain the earliest reference to Yahweh, the Old Testament name of God, found in Jerusalem. These artifacts point to the timeless appeal of this brief text.\nA number of New Testament letters end with a blessing spoken over the readers in a tone very similar to the priestly blessing of Numbers (e.g., 2 Cor 13:14; Heb 13:20-21).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:28; 9:1, 26-27; 12:1-3; 14:19-20; 28:1-4; 48:15-20; 49:25-26; Lev 9:22; Num 6:22-27; 24:1-9; Deut 10:8; 33:11-29; 1 Sam 2:20; 1 Kgs 8:55-65; 2 Chr 30:27; Pss 115:12-15; 128:1-6; Matt 5:3-11; Luke 11:27-28; 2 Cor 13:14; Eph 6:23; 1 Thes 5:23-24",

    "content": "Bread from Heaven\nAs the Israelites left Egypt behind and entered the wilderness, God sent manna, a breadlike substance, to sustain them (Exod 16). The Lord gave them food adequate for their daily needs (see Neh 9:20-21). This “bread from heaven” showed God’s people his love and illustrated his special provision for Israel in the wilderness (see Deut 8:3, 16; Pss 78:24; 105:40; cp. Rev 2:17).\nAlthough manna was actual food, some passages use the term in a spiritual sense to symbolize a spiritual relationship with the Lord and as a sign of God’s miraculous provision for his people (see 1 Cor 10:3-4). At the same time, manna was associated with Israel’s complaining against God and with their lack of trust in his provision (Num 11:1-15; see 1 Cor 10:5).\nShortly after Jesus had miraculously fed the 5,000 near the Sea of Galilee, he taught in the synagogue at Capernaum about the “bread of life” (John 6:22-59). He identified himself as the “true bread of God” and “the bread of life” (John 6:32-35); he even linked eternal life with the need to “eat [his] flesh” and “drink his blood” (John 6:50-58). Just as the manna provided food in the wilderness, Jesus—the true bread from God—offers spiritual sustenance. Israel was humbled by their need for food in the wilderness (Deut 8:3). Now followers of Jesus must humble themselves and receive the fullness of his life by faith (John 6:35-40, 47-51, 63-64).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 16:1-36; Num 11:1-15; Deut 8:3, 16; Josh 5:10-12; Neh 9:20-21; Pss 78:24; 105:40; John 6:1-15, 22-64; 1 Cor 10:3-5; Rev 2:17",

    "content": "Spirit Empowerment\nThroughout Scripture, when the need arises, God empowers in special ways those who are committed to his service. The account of Moses and the seventy elders is one early instance, and it reminds us that God has moved and worked among his people in special ways throughout the ages. When Moses reached the end of his patience and his ability to manage rebellious Israel (Num 11:1-15), God told him to select seventy men to help him (11:16-17; cp. Exod 18:14-26). Then the Lord redistributed the Spirit that Moses already possessed and empowered these men for service (Num 11:24-25).\nJoshua was empowered by the Lord’s Spirit as Moses’ successor (Num 27:18; cp. Deut 34:9). In the period of the Judges, the Spirit of the Lord came to the aid of Israel’s leaders as, for example, in the work of Othniel (Judg 3:10), Gideon (Judg 6:34), Jephthah (Judg 11:29), and Samson (Judg 13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14). David had access to the strength of God’s presence, and his awareness of God’s actions—in history and in his own experience—made him a great leader (e.g., 1 Sam 16:13; 17:45; 18:12, 28). The prophets knew that their special ministry was possible because of the Spirit’s presence and power (e.g., Isa 61:1; Ezek 11:5; Zech 4:6).\nJesus was filled with God’s Spirit and empowered for a unique ministry (see Matt 12:18; Luke 4:1, 14, 18; John 3:34; Acts 10:38), and he spoke about the Spirit’s special role in the church (Acts 1:8). The arrival of the Spirit enabled the assembled believers to speak powerfully on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:4-5, 16-18; cp. Joel 2:28-29). The Spirit emboldened and empowered the church after Pentecost (Acts 4:31; 19:6; 20:28; 1 Cor 12:1-31; Gal 3:2-5) and remains with God’s people today. The Spirit moves as circumstances require to provide spiritual renewal and strength to God’s people, and the Spirit continues to equip God’s people for whatever tasks he calls them to do.\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 11:16-30; 24:1-9; 27:18-23; Deut 34:10-12; Judg 3:9-10; 6:34; 11:29; 14:5-6, 19; 15:14; 1 Sam 16:13; Pss 23; 46:1; 94:16-19; 116:1-9; 121:1-8; 143:10-12; Isa 61:1; Ezek 11:5; Joel 2:28-29; Zech 4:6; Matt 12:18; Luke 4:1, 14, 18; John 3:34; Acts 1:8; 2:4, 16-18; 4:31; 10:38; 19:6; 20:28; 1 Cor 12:1-31; Gal 3:2-5",

    "content": "The Servant-Leader\nA servant-leader is characterized by an overwhelming desire to accomplish a purpose through serving others. The leader’s heart compels this person to assume a servant role.\nThe Old Testament describes Moses as the Lord’s servant (Exod 14:31; Num 12:7-8). Moses did not seek power, prestige, or material gain, but assumed his leadership role reluctantly. He used his prophetic authority with humility (Num 12:3), knowing that he was subject to God (see Deut 34:10-12; Hos 12:13). Every event in Moses’ story from the time he was called by God indicates that he understood his leadership as derived from his service to God. He was submissive, selfless, and faithful. His interactions with his fellow Israelites were characterized by empathy, persuasiveness, and vision. Moses stood in the gap at a critical moment in Israelite history and repeatedly interceded on behalf of the people. Moses’ remarkably humble submission to God served as the basis for his role as a great leader.\nJesus of Nazareth is the ideal servant-leader. The Gospels portray Jesus as the Lord’s “Suffering Servant” (see Isa 52:13–53:12), especially in his sacrificial death, which was his ultimate act of service (Mark 10:45). Jesus spoke with great authority, but did so humbly, understanding his role as a shepherd who sacrifices his life for his sheep (John 10:11). He spent time with children and used them as models for those who desire to follow God wholeheartedly (Matt 18:4). When James and John asked him to give them an elevated rank in his Kingdom, Jesus criticized their worldly ambition (Mark 10:35-45) and set their priorities straight by instructing them to follow his example of servanthood (Matt 20:24-28; 23:11-12; Mark 10:43-45). As a model for all who want to lead others through a life of service, Jesus understood that his purpose was to bring glory to God’s name (John 12:27-28).\nThe apostles Paul and Peter followed Christ’s example and fulfilled his ideal of servant leadership. Paul’s life of service demonstrated humility and tireless efforts on behalf of others (see 2 Cor 11:23-28). He taught Christians to do the same (Rom 8:17; Gal 5:13; 2 Tim 1:8; 2:3) and praised those who did so (e.g., Phil 2:25-30; Col 4:7). Peter also exemplified self-sacrificial service to Christ (e.g., Acts 3:1-11; 4:13-22; 5:12-16; 9:32-42), and his instructions define the character of a servant-leader clearly and concisely (1 Pet 4:10-11; 5:1-5).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 13:8-12; 14:11-24; 30:31-32; Exod 14:31; Num 12:3, 7-8; Deut 34:10-12; 1 Kgs 12:1-7; Isa 52:13–53:12; Matt 18:4; 20:24-28; 23:11-12; Mark 10:35-45; John 10:11; 12:27-28; Acts 3:1-11; 4:13-22; 5:12-16; 9:32-42; Rom 8:17; 2 Cor 11:23-27; Gal 5:13; Phil 2:25-30; Col 4:7; 2 Tim 1:8; 2:3; 1 Pet 4:10-11; 5:1-5",

    "content": "The Bronze Snake\nNumbers 21:4-9 contains one of many incidents in which the Israelites spoke against God and Moses. When the Israelites complained about their lack of food and water and “this horrible manna” (21:5), the Lord sent poisonous snakes that fatally bit many of the people (cp. Deut 8:15). When the Israelites realized their mistake in speaking against God as well as against Moses, they asked Moses to pray that the Lord would remove the snakes. In response, God instructed Moses to make a bronze replica of a snake; whenever the afflicted would look upon the snake, they would be healed (Num 21:8). What kind of medical treatment was this? The power came from God, but it required an act of faith to look at the bronze image and trust that God would heal. Just as the serpent bites resulted from God’s wrath, the Lord provided deliverance through his own gracious will (see Wisdom of Solomon 16:5-7).\nWhen Hezekiah became king of Judah in 715 BC, the Israelites had begun using Moses’ bronze serpent as an idol (see 2 Kgs 18:1-4). They had probably kept the image as a reminder of God’s power, just as they kept other artifacts from the wilderness period (see Deut 10:5; Heb 9:4-5). But they began worshiping it as another deity, so it had to be destroyed like other pagan shrines and sacred pillars. Such idolatry is a serious threat to the worship of the one true God (cp. Exod 32).\nJesus referred to the incident of the bronze snake to predict the manner of his execution: He would be “lifted up” on the cross just as Moses had lifted up the snake on a pole (John 3:14-15; see also 8:28; 12:32-33). The metal image of a snake offered an antidote to injected venom; by analogy, those who look at the cross and accept God’s sacrifice lay claim to an eternal promise (John 3:14-16). The Lord sent the serpents to punish Israel because they complained about the manna God had sent them in the wilderness (Num 21:4-9). Jesus referred to himself as the “true bread from heaven,” the manna that provides life for his people (John 6:32-40).\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 21:4-9; 2 Kgs 18:1-4; John 3:14-15; 6:32-40; 8:28; 12:30-34",

    "content": "The Cloud and Fire\nWhen Israel was in the wilderness, God led the nation with a pillar of cloud and fire. The pillar joined the Israelites right after the first Passover, immediately after Israel left Egypt (Exod 13:20-22).\nThe pillar served a variety of functions. When the Egyptians pursued the Israelites, the cloud moved behind the people of Israel and prevented an Egyptian advance (Exod 14:19-20). Through the rest of Israel’s travels, it was a visible indication that “the Lord went ahead of them” (Exod 13:21). When the pillar settled over the Tabernacle and the camp of Israel, it represented the Lord’s presence and protection. The cloud and fire also provided divine guidance by indicating when the Israelites should move (Exod 40:36-38; Num 9:17-23). When the pillar was stationary, Israel stayed where they were. When it lifted and moved on, the Israelites broke camp and followed. They camped in different places for varying amounts of time, sometimes briefly and sometimes for a longer period. Israel thus “camped or traveled at the Lord’s command” (Num 9:23). The pillar of cloud and fire was like a divine banner flying over the tribes on the march (cp. 10:14, 18, 22, 25).\nThe pillar regularly appeared as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (9:15-16; Exod 13:21). In the Bible, both fire and clouds often indicate the presence and glory of God (e.g., Exod 19:16-18; 24:15-18; Matt 17:5; 24:30; Acts 1:9; cp. Ps 18:8-13). The cloud and fire imagery indicated that God’s presence and glory moved with Israel through the wilderness. This special manifestation of God (a theophany) stayed with them “throughout all their journeys” while they were in the wilderness (Exod 40:38; see also Exod 13:22). Sometimes, “the cloud covered the Tabernacle, and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle,” so that “Moses could no longer enter the Tabernacle” (Exod 40:34-35). On other occasions, the cloud descended and hovered near the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, indicating that the Lord was speaking with Moses “face to face” (Exod 33:7-11; cp. Num 11:25; 12:5; Deut 31:15). The pillar of cloud and fire was a constant, reassuring reminder of the Lord’s presence. We are not given any specific description of the fire and the cloud other than that it was shaped like a pillar; regardless, it was a powerful symbol of God’s special care for Israel (see Neh 9:19-21; cp. Pss 46:1; 139; John 1:14; Rom 8:31-39).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 13:20-22; 14:19-24; 16:10; 19:16-18; 24:15-18; 33:7-11; 40:34-38; Lev 16:2; Num 9:15-23; 10:11-12, 34; 11:25; 12:5, 10; 14:14; 16:42; Deut 31:15; 1 Kgs 8:11; 2 Chr 5:14; Neh 9:19-21; Pss 78:14; 99:7; 104:3; Ezek 1:4-5; 10:3; Matt 17:5; 24:30; 26:64; Luke 9:34-35; Acts 1:9; 1 Cor 10:2; 1 Thes 4:17; Rev 1:7; 14:14-16",

    "content": "Biblical Law\nBiblical law is more than lists of dos and don’ts. It is a system of divine expectations regarding belief and behavior which, if faithfully carried out, will bring God’s richest blessing. Life itself depends on keeping the law (Deut 4:1; see also 5:32-33; 8:1; 16:20).\nThe exodus from Egypt freed the nation of Israel to become God’s servant. When God delivered Israel from bondage by “a strong hand, a powerful arm, and terrifying acts” (4:34), it was not because Israel had earned this right through its own righteousness but because God is gracious and faithful to his promises to Abraham. The purpose of the rescue from Egypt was not just to relieve the Israelites of their onerous burdens (Exod 1:11-22; 5:4-23), but to make a covenant with them. The covenant relationship did not make the Israelites God’s people; they already were his people (see Exod 4:22-23). Obedience was not a precondition to the covenant but the proper response to it. It placed on them the responsibility of serving God as a priestly kingdom and a holy nation (Exod 19:4-6). The law was given to regulate Israel’s affairs as a nation so that God’s people would be a beacon of his unfailing love and faithfulness.\nThe covenant guaranteed the people of Israel abundant and meaningful life if they kept the law. The covenant document consists of broad principles, patterns, and standards. God’s instructions are embodied most famously in the Ten Commandments (Deut 5:6-21) and most succinctly in the Shema (6:4-5). All other laws of God are interpretations and applications of these primary principles.\nThe life that resulted from obedience to the law was not eternal life in the New Testament sense. It was God’s promise that if the Israelites were faithful to the covenant, the nation could expect long and prosperous days in the land (4:1; 5:16, 33). Jesus also exhorted his disciples to keep the Ten Commandments and the demands of the Shema (Matt 22:37-40)—not to have eternal life but as an expression of commitment to him (cp. Matt 5:17-19; John 14:15-21).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 19:4-6; Lev 18:5; Deut 4:1-2; 5:6-21, 32-33; 6:1-9; 8:1; 30:1-20; Matt 5:17-48; 22:36-40; John 14:15-21; Rom 3:19-24; 7:1-12; 1 Cor 9:20-21; Gal 3:1-22; 5:14; Heb 7:18-19; 10:1",

    "content": "The Central Sanctuary\nGod wanted worship to be carried out in the place where he had established his name. For Israel, this place was the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem.\nGod is transcendent (above all things) and omnipresent (present everywhere), yet he chose a specific place for Israel to worship him. Solomon later asked how the God of heaven could be housed in a human structure (1 Kgs 8:27). The answer is that God’s name stands in his place. The Tabernacle and then the Temple belonged to him and bore his name, so they were, in a sense, his dwelling places. In the ancient Near East, names were more than labels. They represented the character and nature of the named individuals (e.g., Jacob, Gen 27:36; Jesus, Matt 1:21; Barnabas, Acts 4:36; Peter, Matt 16:17-19). Thus Solomon could advise, “Choose a good reputation [name] over great riches” (Prov 22:1).\nGod made his home in a sanctuary that bore his name. His glorious presence manifested in fire and cloud during the wilderness wanderings served as a constant reminder that he was at home among his people (Exod 40:34-35); likewise, upon the completion of the Temple, his presence was evidenced (1 Kgs 8:10-11).\nGod would later come to dwell among his people in the person of Jesus Christ (John 1:14), thereby eliminating the need for a central sanctuary (see John 4:19-24). And now, because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, all believers are able to house God’s presence (1 Cor 3:16-17; 6:19-20; 2 Cor 6:16; Eph 2:21).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 25:8-9, 22, 40; 26:30; 33:7-11; 40:34-35; Num 7:1; 11:16; Deut 12:4-7; 31:14-15; 1 Kgs 8:10-11, 27; John 1:14; 2:19-21; Acts 7:44; 1 Cor 3:16-17; 6:19-20; 2 Cor 6:16; Eph 2:21; Heb 8:2, 5; Rev 21:22",

    "content": "Purge the Evil\nSin is so abhorrent to God that it cannot coexist with him. The same should be true for his people. God is holy, and he expects his people to reflect his holiness (Lev 11:45; 19:2).\nGod required severe measures to remove sin from the covenant community. God offered forgiveness, but only for the truly repentant; those who hardened their hearts could expect God’s judgment—a purging process that devours sinners and their sins and leaves nothing behind (see Deut 9:3; 13:5; Isa 33:14; Heb 12:28-29). Such cleansing is meant to heal the community of believers and deter others from rebelling against the Lord (Deut 17:13).\nIn the Old Testament, God’s judgment among his people was often immediate (see, e.g., Num 11:1-3; 16:1-50; Josh 7). God thus made his people keenly aware of his demand for obedience and of the penalty for those who did not comply.\nGod’s retribution is now reserved for the future day of judgment, when the sins of the unrighteous will be exposed and judged (Rom 14:10; 2 Cor 5:10; Heb 9:27; 1 Pet 4:5). However, some instances of calamity can be understood as God’s judgment on his disobedient children (e.g., Acts 5:1-11; see 1 Cor 11:27-30). It is still a “terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (Heb 10:31).\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 19:1-2; Deut 9:3-6; 13:5; 17:2-13; Josh 7:1-26; 2 Chr 34:3-8; Isa 1:24-26; 4:2-6; 33:14; Ezek 20:32-38; Matt 18:8-9; Acts 5:1-11; Rom 14:10; 1 Cor 11:27-30; 2 Cor 5:10; Heb 9:27-28; 10:31; 12:28-29; Jas 5:19-20; 1 Pet 4:5",

    "content": "True Justice\nThe community of God’s people in Old Testament Israel was to be responsible for the well-being of widows, orphans, and foreigners (Deut 27:19). The Israelites were to represent the just God whom they served (see 10:17-19) and always remember that they had been an enslaved and defenseless people in Egypt (see 10:19; 24:18-22). How could they, the beneficiaries of God’s unfailing love and faithfulness, ignore the rights and needs of the most vulnerable who lived among them?\nEvery society has social structures that separate the powerful from the weak and the privileged from the ill-favored. This was true of Old Testament Israel despite its unique constitution and commission as a “holy nation” (Exod 19:6). Judges and other officials charged with upholding the law might tend to favor individuals with financial means, high social standing, or community influence, especially when these individuals offer bribes (Deut 16:19). However, God cannot be bribed, nor does he show partiality (10:17). The rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the exalted and the downtrodden are all alike to him.\nThe prophets of Israel understood the need for equity and justice and often called for the application of these principles to community and national life (Isa 1:17; 10:1-4; 59:14-19; Ezek 22:23-29; Amos 2:6-8; Hab 1:4). The New Testament also appeals for proper treatment of the poor and disadvantaged and speaks of God’s displeasure when they are neglected (Matt 23:23; 2 Cor 9:6-10; Jas 2:1-7).\nJustice that falls short of God’s standard is not true justice, and those responsible for corrupting justice can expect full retribution from the Judge of all the earth (see Deut 25:13-16).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 23:3; Lev 19:15; Deut 10:17-19; 16:19; 24:12-22; 25:13-16; 27:19; Ps 82:1-5; Prov 11:1; Isa 1:17; 10:1-4; 11:3-4; 59:14-19; Jer 22:13-17; Ezek 22:23-29; 45:9-10; Amos 2:6-8; 8:5-6; Hab 1:4; Matt 23:23; Luke 18:6-8; Jas 2:1-7",

    "content": "Curses and Blessings\nNearly all treaty or covenant texts from the ancient Near East contained curses and blessings. The curses were leveled against those who violated the terms of the agreement, while blessings were promised to the faithful. This was particularly true of suzerain-vassal covenants like Deuteronomy (see Deuteronomy Book Introduction, “Literary Form”).\nDeuteronomy presented to the assembly of Israel what God expected of the nation. The covenant required the nation of Israel to obey the Lord, and the Israelites had pledged to do so (Exod 19:8). The section on curses and blessings (Deut 27:1–29:1) spells out how God would reward their obedience and judge their disobedience. The curses receive more emphasis than the blessings, perhaps because people naturally pay more attention to promises than to warnings. Blessings may also be more easily understood—promised blessings in the future seem to simply provide well-being, whereas judgment is more abstract and needs detailed, graphic description. God emphasizes the curses to drive home the consequences of wrongdoing. The warnings Jesus offered about things to come (Matt 24–25) were very much in line with these warnings.\nIsrael’s subsequent history bears witness to God’s promise of both the blessings and the curses. When Israel was faithful to their covenant with God, he blessed the people. When they rebelled, he brought judgment upon them. Israel’s history of rebellion is succinctly summarized in 2 Kings 17:7-20. When the Israelites broke the first two commandments (Deut 5:7-10), they proceeded to violate the whole covenant, and their rebellion brought upon them the curses of Deuteronomy 28.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 9:24-27; Lev 26:3-45; Deut 8:7-20; 11:29; Deut 27:1–29:1; Josh 8:33-35; 2 Kgs 17:7-20; 2 Chr 36:17-21",

    "content": "God’s Covenant Love\nOften in the Bible, God’s love is understood in the ordinary sense that God has strongly affectionate feelings toward humankind. In certain contexts, however, such as the covenant document of Deuteronomy, love refers to God’s commitment to his people.\nIn the ancient Near East, a conquering king would characteristically speak of his relationship to vassal peoples in terms of love, meaning that he had chosen those people to enjoy his favor and to benefit from his protection in exchange for their loyal service. Similarly, God chose Israel to be his servant nation not because the Israelites deserved it but because he loved them (Deut 7:6-11). Put another way, he loved them because he had chosen them. The strongest affirmation of God’s love-choice can be found in Malachi 1:2-3: God chose Jacob but rejected Esau (see also Rom 9:13-26).\nThe special covenantal relationship that God had with Israel was extended to include both Jews and Gentiles through Jesus Christ (Acts 10:1–11:18; Eph 2:11-22). This new covenant was established through the ultimate demonstration of God’s love in the suffering and death of his son (Luke 22:20; John 3:16).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 7:6-11; 33:3; Isa 49:14-18; Hos 11:1-11; Mal 1:2-3; Matt 3:16-17; Luke 15:1-32; John 3:16; 16:25-27; Rom 5:6-8; 9:13-26; Eph 1:4; 2:4-7; Heb 12:6-11; 1 Jn 3:1; 4:8-9, 16",

    "content": "Holy War\nThe Israelites’ complete annihilation of their enemies poses a major ethical problem. What justification could Israel have had for invading, conquering, and destroying the land of Canaan and its peoples? From a human perspective, it appears that Israel’s aggressive campaigns to settle Canaan were illegal and immoral. Scripture, however, offers a couple of insights that, while not fully eliminating the difficulty in understanding this issue, provide some help.\nFirst, the war against the Canaanites was commanded and led by God himself, not by mere human decision. The holy God was present with Israel in a unique way (Exod 19:5-6; 40:34-38). After Israel crossed the Jordan, it became clear that God himself was fighting against the Canaanites (e.g., Josh 6); and when he wasn’t, Israel was defeated (Josh 7). God himself defines what is and is not moral based on his own character. For ancient Israel, that included the notion that in order for the holy God to remain present with his people, the prospect of evil and corruptibility had to be dealt with in a decisive way (see Deut 7:1-6; Deut 20:16-18; see also Num 25; Judg 2:1-15).\nSecond, the people of Canaan had rebelled against God and had become thoroughly wicked (see, e.g., Gen 34:1-2). At the time of Abraham, God declared that the sins of the Canaanites did not yet warrant their destruction (Gen 15:16). Now, several hundred years later, they did—they were committing horrible crimes against God and their fellow human beings, including idolatry, child sacrifice, adultery, incest, murder, and oppression (see Lev 18). These sins thoroughly defiled the land and its people (Lev 18:24-25). The holy God was exercising his justice against excessive wickedness.\nIt is important to recognize that the war that Israel was authorized to wage was thus limited historically and theologically to that specific time and place and people. Medieval campaigns, such as the Crusades by European “Christians” against Middle Eastern “infidels,” or the more recent jihads of Islamic terrorism cannot be justified based on it. Jesus made it very clear that “God blesses those who work for peace” (Matt 5:9) and that “those who use the sword will die by the sword” (Matt 26:52). Jesus himself, as the Messiah, was expected to lead Israel in military victory over the Romans; instead, he gave up his life sacrificially to defeat the ultimate enemies of sin, death, and Satan. God has reserved for himself the right of judgment (Rom 12:19), and in the final judgment, he will pour out his holy wrath on human wickedness (see Rev 19:11-21; 20:7-10). Therefore, no one can now rightly claim that God has commanded that a particular group of people should be killed. No justification for genocide exists in the modern world.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:1; 13:14-17; 15:16, 18-21; Deut 1:30; Deut 7:1-6, 16-26; 20:1-4, 10-18; 32:8-9; Judg 3:27-30; 1 Sam 7:7-11; 2 Chr 13:12-19; 20:20-24; Isa 13:1-5; Joel 3:1-16; Matt 5:9; 26:50-54; Rev 19:11-21; 20:7-15",

    "content": "The Cities of Refuge\nThe cities of refuge were built to protect innocent people from blood revenge. An avenger had the legal right to put a murderer to death (Num 35:19; see Gen 9:6). If a person caused someone’s death accidentally, the slayer fled to a city of refuge to find temporary safety while awaiting trial (Num 35:22-28). The six cities of refuge were distributed across Hebrew territory so that any Israelite could seek asylum.\nIf, after trial, the fugitive was convicted of murder (instead of involuntary manslaughter), he was turned over to the avenger and received his due punishment (Deut 19:12). If he was found innocent of murder, the slayer remained in the city of refuge, where he was granted asylum. When the high priest died, the slayer was free to return home and was no longer subject to blood revenge. This merciful legal arrangement protected the land from further pollution by innocent blood (see Num 35:33).\nIt was not acceptable to pay a fine to atone for the death of another human being, even if that death was not premeditated (Num 35:31-33). Human life was too precious to be ransomed with a simple payment. When a human being was killed, whether deliberately or by accident, it resulted in alienation or exile.\nAtonement does not come easily, whether in ancient Israelite times or in our own day; each person is in need of atonement to restore their relationship with God (see Rom 3:23-26). Jesus, the Son of God, provides this reconciliation through his work as the Great High Priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice (see Heb 4:14–10:18).\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 35:6-34; Deut 19:1-13; Josh 20:1-9; 21:13, 21, 27, 32, 38; 1 Kgs 1:50-53; 2:28-34",

    "content": "Community Responsibility: Achan’s Sin\nShould an entire community be held responsible for the sins of a smaller few?\nWhy did so many of Israel’s soldiers die at Ai because of Achan’s sin (Josh 7)? Why did the Israelites stone Achan’s family along with him? A significant part of the answer to these questions comes by understanding the concept of community responsibility.\nIf Achan’s family knew of his theft, they were accomplices and shared Achan’s guilt. A community becomes responsible for sin when people either actively participate in an act of sin or silently condone sinful actions or attitudes.\nBut what about Achan’s children who were too young to understand or those who had no knowledge of his theft? What about Israel’s soldiers who died at Ai because Achan stole what belonged to God?\nTo understand, we have to go back to the beginning. The sin of our first parents, Adam and Eve (Gen 3), was at least twofold. First, they chose not to trust God, even though they had an intimate relationship with him, choosing instead to listen to the voice of a stranger. Second, though they were unsuccessful, they declared their independence from God by trying to become like gods themselves.\nBecause we all make that same choice for ourselves, no one is truly innocent (see Ps 14:2-3; Rom 3:9-23). As a result, we are all subject to the consequences of sin in the world. We may die as the result of another’s sin, carelessness, or ignorance, or as a result of our own. Because one person drives under the influence of alcohol, someone else might die on the highway. Because one person wants to maximize profits, others can suffer in wretched conditions. And because Achan sinned, others in Israel died at Ai.\nNone of this is “fair.” However, God promises to bring perfect justice in his own time.

    "content": "Shechem\nShechem was strategically located at the entrance to the pass between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, where it could control several key roads through the central hill country. Jacob bought land near Shechem (Gen 33:18-19). While there, Jacob’s daughter, Dinah, was raped by the prince of the area (whose name was Shechem); in response, two of Dinah’s brothers, Simeon and Levi, killed all the men of the land (Gen 34). Later, the town of Shechem became part of Joseph’s inheritance (Josh 24:32) and one of the cities of refuge (see Deut 19:1-13; Josh 20:7).\nDuring the period of the judges, Gideon’s son Abimelech ruled from Shechem (Judg 9). Solomon later fortified Shechem as a provincial capital, but it was sacked soon after, probably by Shishak of Egypt when he invaded Israel in 926 BC (see 1 Kgs 14:25). Jeroboam I then refortified the city and made it the capital of the kingdom of Israel (1 Kgs 12:25). Shechem was again destroyed, this time by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser V, in 724 BC, shortly before the destruction of Samaria, and the ruins were virtually uninhabited for about four hundred years.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 33:18-19; Josh 8:30-35; 20:7; 24:1-32; Judg 9:1-56; 1 Kgs 12:1, 25; John 4:5",

    "content": "Inheriting the Land\nIs the material world evil? Are spirit, soul, and energy the pure good toward which we are striving on our earthly journey? Will we only be truly spiritual and truly happy when we are finally free from the prison of this earth-bound flesh?\nThe Bible answers these and similar questions with an emphatic “No!” The universe, including this earth and all its bodily creatures, came from the skilled and expert hand of the loving Creator and was considered “very good” (Gen 1:31). As a result of our sin, this material world needs redeeming, and by God’s grace, it will have a share in God’s redemption at the end of time (see Rom 8:19-21).\nOne of the ways Scripture affirms the goodness and relevance of this world is by a prominent theology of land. All land belongs to God. God evicted the Canaanite peoples from the Promised Land because of their wickedness. He brought Israel into that land because of his promises to the patriarchs and because he wants the earth to be under human stewards who are attuned to its Maker.\nIn ancient Israel, this stewardship was facilitated through the allotment of a livable portion of land to each household. Strictly speaking, the allotment of the land, rather than the land itself, was the stewardship trust. The allotment passed down from fathers to sons as the main part of most family inheritances. Following these principles and God’s specific instruction, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, and the tribes divided it among their clans, families, and individual households. God’s gift of stewardship over a specific portion of land was essentially the gift of life to each household.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:31; 12:7; 13:14-17; 15:12-21; 17:7-8; 35:11-13; 50:24; Josh 13:1–21:45; Ps 37:9-34; Luke 12:22-34; 16:9-11",

    "content": "Oppression of God’s People\nGod does not want his people to be oppressed. From the exodus under Moses to Joshua’s conquest and David’s battles, God’s goal for Israel was complete victory over their enemies (see Josh 1:1-9). Similarly, the New Testament consistently speaks of freedom from the oppression of sin (Rom 6:1-14; Gal 5:1-15) as an inalienable blessing of a relationship with Christ.\nWhy, then, does oppression exist? The book of Judges suggests that it is because of human disobedience. Israel was promised victory in the conquest if they would obey God, but the reality (Judg 1:19-36) was only partial obedience at best. With the rewards of victory in view, why did God’s people of old—and why does the church today—fall short?\nIn Judges, the answer was that “another generation” arose that had not participated in the Exodus or the conquest under Joshua, so their faith was increasingly based on stories of divine intervention “in the olden days.” They had not personally “seen all the great things the Lord had done for Israel” (2:7). This generation failed to “acknowledge the Lord or remember the mighty things he had done for Israel” (2:10). God had left enemies in the land to test the Israelites (3:1-4), and Israel failed to drive out these enemies as God had commanded. The rest of the book of Judges illustrates the tragic results of that failure.\nGod only turns away from his people when they have turned away from him (2:12-14); he never abandons people who truly worship him. Yet grace notes are sounded even in divine retribution as God turned his anger to a beneficial purpose: to teach his people obedience. The very foes who robbed Israel of its divine inheritance and blessing became part of God’s gracious testing. We can learn from oppression, as both physical and spiritual warfare require discipline. The experience can produce a “peaceful harvest of right living” (see Heb 12:5-11).\nThrough Jesus Christ, God brought undeserved deliverance from the universal oppression of sin, “while we were still sinners” (Rom 5:8). And just as the Israelites experienced deliverance from their enemies whenever they turned to the Lord, we can be rescued from the ultimate oppressive force when we turn to him in repentance.\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 26:14-39; Deut 8:19-20; 28:15-68; Judg 2:2-3, 10-15,18; 3:1-8; 2 Kgs 17:5-23; Ezek 22:27-29; Amos 4:1; Jas 2:1-7",

    "content": "Charismatic Leadership\nSome leaders in Scripture are described as charismatic (gifted) because their authority did not come from an office or a structure but from the inspiration of God’s Spirit, who gave them particular qualities.\nThe judges are often included among this group. These charismatic leaders arose in troubled and unsettled times and in response to a crisis. In Judges, these crises were repeatedly precipitated by the fact that “the Israelites did evil in the Lord’s sight” (Judg 3:12; 4:1; 6:1; Judg 10:6; 13:1), with enemy oppression as the inevitable result.\nThe inspired leadership of the judges fits a pattern. The judges were “raised up” by the Spirit and were sustained by prophetic affirmation. What might have led to prophetic utterance in other periods of Israel’s history (e.g., 1 Sam 10:6; 2 Sam 23:2; Isa 61:1; Ezek 11:5; Mic 3:8), in the times of the judges led to physical prowess (e.g., Samson, Judg 14:6, 19; 15:14), skill, or commanding authority (Judg 3:10; 6:34; 11:29).\nJesus and the apostles exercised charismatic leadership. As the Jewish authorities were fond of pointing out, Jesus had no “official” authority; yet, he displayed tremendous power and gained a signifcant following. And although the apostles were appointed to what we might consider to be an “office,” there was at that time virtually no structure to back up the office; when they exercised authority, it was purely charismatic. Peter’s healing of the beggar (Acts 3:1-8) provides a classic contrast between the accoutrements of office, such as “silver and gold,” and true spiritual power.\nCharisma has been a powerful tool for effective leadership from the heroes of Israel to the present time. But the successes of charismatic leadership can also be fleeting, particularly when the Spirit, who equips such leaders, is no longer operational in the leader’s life (see Judg 16:20-21; 1 Sam 16:14; Isa 63:10). Those who have been specially gifted by the Spirit to lead must continually be mindful of and dependent on that same Spirit.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 31:2-5; Judg 2:16-19; 3:10, 27-28; 6:34-35; 11:29; 14:6, 19; 15:14; 1 Sam 10:6; 16:13-18; 2 Sam 23:2; Isa 61:1; Ezek 11:5; Mic 3:8; Matt 3:16–4:2; Acts 6:8; 8:4-40; Rom 1:11; 12:6-8; 1 Cor 12:4-11; Eph 4:11-12",

    "content": "God’s Grief over Apostasy\nThe God of the universe is grieved by his people’s misery (10:16; Hos 11:8-9). Even when repeatedly spurned, God’s love is more powerful than his wrath, and his compassion exceeds his indignation. That does not mean that his love negates his justice, however, and people will ultimately be judged in the end for their choices and actions (see 2Tim 4:1; Rev 20:11-15).\nThe entire era of the judges shows what happens in God’s heart when his people repeatedly spurn him. There comes a point, as in the time of Noah (Gen 6:5-7), when God’s patience runs out. For the Israelites who inhabited the land of the judges, that time had come. At one point, after the Israelites had turned to worship other gods and God had allowed them to be oppressed by their enemies, God responded to their plea for help by saying, “Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen! Let them rescue you” (Judg 10:14). Yet, even then, when Israel repeated its plea for mercy, rid themselves of their idols, and submitted to the Lord’s justice (10:10, 15-16), he provided help.\nGod longs for people to turn to him in repentance, not wanting anyone to be destroyed (2 Pet 3:9). And in his justice, he “makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus” (Rom 3:26). He has taken upon himself the grievous weight of our sin (see Isa 53:3-12; 2 Cor 5:19-21) and given us the opportunity to receive his grace.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 6:5-7; Judg 10:6-16; Isa 5:1-7; 53:3-12; 63:10; Hos 11:8-9; Eph 4:30",

    "content": "Social Chaos in Judges\nWhile the book of Judges celebrates divine rescue through heroes, it also chronicles the inadequacy of the status quo. A decline in individual piety throughout the period was accompanied by a rise in social dysfunction, powerfully expressed in chapter 5 (e.g., 5:6-8). Three features of the times stand out: First, the tribes had little ability to function in unison, even when faced by a common enemy (see, e.g., the Gideon and Jephthah stories; chs 8, 12). The civil strife within and between tribes reflects covenant disobedience.\nSecond, the breakdown of civil society is also evidenced throughout the book. Abimelech’s murder of Gideon’s sons, Jephthah’s apparent sacrifice of his daughter, and Samson’s acts of revenge toward the Philistines highlight the depravity and lack of civility that characterized this period.\nThird, religious apostasy was widespread in those days. The “evil in the Lord’s sight” committed by the Israelites was repeatedly connected to idolatry (Judg 2:11-13; 3:7; 10:6). The altar to Baal and the Asherah pole in Gideon’s town of Ophrah (6:25-30) indicate flagrant abandonment of the Lord, as do the worship of the golden ephod made by Gideon (8:27) and the return to worshiping Baal after Gideon’s death (8:33-35). Samson’s intermarriage with the Philistines also directly contradicted the covenant commands (see Deut 7:1-4).\nSocial chaos culminates in the closing chapters (Judg 17–21). The incident of Micah, the Levite, and the Danites (chs 17–18) combines religious irregularities with lawless marauding, theft, and violence. The climactic final epilogue (chs 19–21) describes a tragic civil war and the utter abandonment of civility. Marital breakdown, inhospitality, rape, and murder (ch 19) led to the near elimination of the Benjamites (ch 20), who were spared only by the complete decimation of a historic city (Jabesh-gilead) and a sham ceremony in which maidens were seized to become wives (21:6-23). Little wonder that the book concludes, “In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes” (21:25).\nPassages for Further Study\nJudg 5:6-8; 6:25-27; 8:1-35; 12:1-15; 17:1–21:25; Ps 11:2-7; Prov 28:2-3; Jer 5:7-9; 12:1-17; Mic 3:9-12; 7:2-7; Rom 1:21-32; Gal 5:19-23",

    "content": "The Family Redeemer\nThe idea of a family redeemer, established in the law of Moses, finds a vivid example in the story of Ruth. In that book, the expression “family redeemer” has a specific, technical meaning. Elsewhere, the underlying Hebrew term go’el is translated “nearest relative” (Num 27:11; 35:19, 24).\nAccording to the law, family redeemers had three main responsibilities in Israel:\n1. Leviticus 25:23-34 stipulates that if an Israelite became so poor that he had to sell his land, a family member was to pay off the debt so the land would remain in the family. If no relative could purchase the land and the seller was unable to buy it back, the land still reverted to the seller or his heirs in the Jubilee (fiftieth) Year. Two examples of family redeemers buying land for their relatives are Boaz (Ruth 4:1-12) and Jeremiah (Jer 32:6-15).\n2. Similarly, if an Israelite became so poor he had to sell himself into debt-slavery, a family redeemer was to buy his relative from service to a non-relative (Lev 25:35-55). The poor Israelite would pay off his debt by working for his relative, who could be expected to treat him better than a stranger would.\n3. The family redeemer was to pursue justice for an Israelite killed by another’s hand, under conditions described in Num 35:9-34.\nThe concept of the family redeemer reminds us that God is the true owner of all things, and he commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves (Lev 19:18; Matt 22:39-40). The New Testament presents Jesus as the perfect family redeemer, buying us from the slavery to sin and death into which we had sold ourselves (Matt 20:28; Rom 3:24-25; Eph 1:7; Titus 2:14; Rev 5:9; cp. Exod 6:6; 15:13; Ps 130:8; Isa 44:22; 59:20; 63:9; Jer 31:11). In the spirit of the Old Testament family redeemer (such as Boaz) and following the example of our great Redeemer, we, too, are commanded to act with love and compassion toward others (Lev 19:11-18; Matt 5:43-48; 19:19; 22:37-40; Rom 13:8-10; Gal 5:14; Jas 2:8-9).\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 25:23-55; Num 35:9-34; Ruth 2:20; 3:9, 12; 4:1-10; Isa 59:20; Jer 32:6-15; Matt 20:28; Rom 3:24-25; Eph 1:7; Titus 2:14; Rev 5:9",

    "content": "Vows to God\nThe essence of a vow to God is, “If God will do X, then I will dedicate Y” to God or his sanctuary. Examples include Jacob’s tithing (Gen 28:20-22), the Israelites’ dealing with the Canaanite spoils of war (Num 21:2), Hannah’s dedicating her son as a lifelong servant of the Lord (1 Sam 1:11), and Absalom’s sacrificing to God at Hebron (2 Sam 15:8).\nGuidelines for vows are frequently mentioned in the sacrificial laws. Israelites made vows conditional upon God’s granting their requests. Then they would pay or fulfill their vows to God, often by giving offerings (e.g., Lev 7:16; 22:23; Deut 12:11).\nHowever, vows could be abused. The law itself warns against this (Deut 23:21-23), as do the wisdom teachings (e.g., Prov 7:10-14; 20:25) and the books of the prophets (see, e.g., Jer 44:25). Saul was prone both to make foolish vows (1 Sam 14:24-28) and to not keep the vows he made (19:6). Impulsive vows might go unfulfilled and never paid, arousing God’s anger. Not making a vow is better than backing out of one (Eccl 5:3-5). Jesus counsels us not to make vows, but simply to keep our word (Matt 5:33-37; cp. Jas 5:12).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 28:20-22; Num 21:2-3; 30:1-16; Deut 23:18-23; Judg 11:30-40; 1 Sam 1:11, 24-28; 14:24-45; Ps 76:11; Prov 20:25; Eccl 5:3-5; Mal 1:14; Matt 5:33-37; Acts 18:18; 21:23-24; Jas 5:12",

    "content": "The Ark of the Covenant\nThe Ark of the Covenant was a wooden chest overlaid with gold, and it was placed within the Most Holy Place in the sanctuary. The Ark reminded Israel of God’s covenant with them; its contents included the tablets of the covenant (the Ten Commandments). On the Day of Atonement, the high priest would sprinkle blood on the Ark’s cover in order to purify the people (Lev 16:2-17).\nDuring Israel’s wilderness wanderings, the glory of God would appear over the Ark, and God would meet with his people there (see Exod 25:22). Throughout Israel’s history, the Ark served as a sign of God’s presence. It was carried before the people as they traveled (Num 10:33-36), and when it was brought to the Jordan River, the water stopped up so the Israelites could pass through on dry ground (Josh 3:4-6). The Ark was carried around Jericho before that city was invaded and was present during the siege of the Ammonite city of Rabbah during David’s time (2 Sam 11:1-11).\nThe Philistines equated the Ark with Israel’s God (1 Sam 4:6-8). This is understandable because the Philistines brought images of their own gods into battle (2 Sam 5:21). The Israelites were not to use images of the divine, so they viewed the Ark as the Lord’s footstool and temporary residence rather than his image (see 1 Chr 28:2). However, the Israelites developed an idolatrous, pagan point of view. They treated the sacred symbol as a fetish and tried to manipulate God’s presence for their own benefit. They reasoned, “If the Ark is with us, then God’s presence and favor in battle will also be with us” (see 1 Sam 4:3). As their defeat that day showed (4:1-11), God cannot be manipulated—he is the ruler of his people, and he must be obeyed and trusted (cp. Josh 5:13-15).\nEventually, King David moved the Ark to Jerusalem (2 Sam 6:1-17). When Solomon built the Temple, the Ark was placed in the Most Holy Place, and it continued to play a central role in Israelite worship (1 Kgs 8:1-11). After the early monarchical period, the Ark is not mentioned again. Presumably, it was destroyed by the Babylonians along with the Temple in 586 BC, though an apocryphal tradition claimed that the prophet Jeremiah had hidden the Ark at the time of the Exile (2 Macc 2:4-8). Regardless, the arrival of God’s presence through Jesus Christ and the all-sufficient nature of his sacrifice rendered the Ark unnecessary (see Heb 9:1–10:18).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 25:10-22; 40:20-21; Lev 16:2; Num 10:33-36; Deut 31:25-26; Josh 3:4-6; 6:6-13; Judg 20:26-28; 1 Sam 4:3-11; 5:1–7:2; 2 Sam 6:1-17; Jer 3:16-18",

    "content": "Monarchy\nOne reason the nation of Israel wanted a king was to be “like all the other nations.” The institution of kingship in other ancient Near Eastern nations was almost two thousand years old by the time of Saul and David, especially in the Egyptian and Babylonian empires. Other much smaller nations—such as Philistia, Moab, and Edom—also had kings with permanent bureaucracies and standing armies. Kings were believed to be the chosen instruments through which deities governed human affairs, so kings reigned either on behalf of the gods or as presumed gods themselves.\nThe Israelites envied other nations and were not interested in the long-term implications of monarchy, in spite of Samuel’s warnings (1 Sam 8:10-18). Several hundred years of monarchy would prove that Samuel’s apprehensions were justified: Wicked kings eventually led God’s chosen nation into foreign domination and exile. Yet God used the monarchy to fulfill his purposes, as he would provide the Messiah through David and his dynasty, establishing an eternal kingdom (see 2 Sam 7:8-16; Matt 21:1-11; Rev 5:5; 11:15).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 17:14-20; 33:5; Judg 17:6; 21:25; 1 Sam 8:5-22; 10:1, 24-25; 2 Sam 7:8-16; Ps 89:35-37; Eccl 8:2-5; Isa 33:22; Matt 21:1-11; 22:42-46; 27:11; 1 Tim 1:17; 1 Pet 2:13-14; Rev 5:5; 11:15; 15:3",

    "content": "Complete Destruction\nGod instructed Saul to “completely destroy” the Amalekites, who had ambushed the Israelites after the Exodus (see Exod 17:8-16; Deut 25:17-19). The Hebrew word kharam (“completely destroy”) often means dedicating something or someone completely to the Lord, either by destroying it (1 Sam 15:3; Josh 6:17-18) or by giving it as an offering (see Lev 27:28-29; Josh 6:19).\nComplete destruction was called for in cases where those to be destroyed had committed a severe offense against God, such as worshiping false gods (Deut 7:1-6; 13:12-18). In 1 Samuel 15:3, complete destruction is prescribed as God’s judgment on a nation that mistreated his chosen people. Those who curse God’s family are, in turn, cursed (Gen 12:3).\nGod still judges the godless and impenitent. But in the new covenant, Christians are not called to be agents of such judgment. God calls us to exercise his mercy toward those who wrong us (see Luke 9:51-56). We must completely destroy whatever within ourselves wars against Christ (Rom 8:12-13; Col 3:5). And we must overcome the enemies of Christ by our faith, by the Good News, and by our love (Eph 6:10-20; 1 Jn 2:9-17).

    "content": "God’s Change of Mind\nThirty-four times in the Old Testament, God is said to “change his mind” or “be sorry” (Hebrew nakham). What could this mean? Did he relent, or did he have pity? Was he sorry, or did he grieve?\nOne thing is clear: God never repents of sin or moral failure, because he is perfect (see 1 Sam 15:29; Num 23:19). He may “change his mind” regarding calamity or judgment that he initiated—that is, he may decide to stop it—in response to prayers of repentance (Jer 18:7-10; Joel 2:14; Jon 3:9-10), a human intercessor (Exod 32:11-14; Amos 7:2-6), or with no apparent human mediation (Judg 2:18; 2 Sam 24:16). On a few occasions, God is “sorry” about something he has already done, such as choosing Saul to be king (1 Sam 15:11, 35; cp. Gen 6:6). Yet God is not admitting past mistakes; he is expressing anguish over lives gone awry.\nTheologians debate the degree to which God, who is all-wise and all-powerful, can “change his mind.” In the Bible, any language that refers to a change in God’s mind reflects a human perspective on God’s activity. Any change in God, therefore, is a change as humans experience him—a reflection of his unchanging love, mercy, faithfulness, and holy will. It does not suggest a change in God’s power, omniscience, foreknowledge, wisdom, or holiness.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 6:6-7; Exod 32:11-14; Num 23:19; Deut 32:36; 1 Sam 15:10-11, 29, 35; 2 Sam 24:15-16; Jer 4:28; 18:7-10; 26:2-19; Ezek 24:14; Joel 2:13-14; Amos 7:2-6; Jon 3:9–4:11",

    "content": "The Spirit’s Presence\nIn the Old Testament, the Spirit of the Lord came upon a person or group when they were called to do a task or ordained for an office. The Spirit “came upon” the judges Othniel, Gideon, and Jephthah (Judg 3:10; 6:34; 11:29), empowering them for service. Saul and David both received the Spirit of God when they were anointed king (1 Sam 10:1, 9-10; 16:13). The Spirit would depart when the task had been completed or when the officeholder was removed from office. When Samuel anointed David as the next king (16:13), the Spirit left Saul (16:14), who was disobedient and had been rejected by God as king (13:7-14; 15:10-29; cp. 28:15; Judg 16:20). After David had sinned with Bathsheba, he prayed to be spared this same judgment (Ps 51:11).\nIn the New Testament, God’s Holy Spirit is given to all who put their faith in Christ for salvation, not just to individuals in specific roles (see Acts 2:14-21; 1 Cor 12:1-13; Eph 1:13-14). Still, the Spirit performs a similar role in equipping God’s servants to do the work that God has called them to do (see 1 Cor 12:7-10). The Old Testament departure of the Spirit from Saul tangibly demonstrates the need for the New Testament warnings not to sin against the Spirit and not to bring sorrow to the Spirit (see Mark 3:28-29; Eph 4:30; Heb 6:1-8).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 41:37-40; Exod 31:1-6; Judg 3:9-11; 6:34; 11:29; 14:5-6; 16:20-21; 1 Sam 10:1-10; 11:6-7; 16:13-23; 19:19-23; 2 Chr 20:13-19; 24:20-22; Ps 51:11-12; Isa 11:1-5; Jer 31:33-34; Joel 2:28-29; Mark 3:28-29; Acts 2:1-21; 4:31; Eph 1:13-14; 4:30; Heb 6:4-8",

    "content": "Calling up the Dead\nThe Old Testament forbids occult practices, such as spiritism, divination, and necromancy, in which someone attempts to contact the dead, usually to seek guidance about the future (see Deut 18:9-12). Practicing necromancy and consulting a necromancer were capital offenses (Lev 20:6, 27; cp. 1 Sam 28:9). God’s people were instead to rely on God for divine guidance.\nGod buried Moses in an unmarked grave (Deut 34:6), possibly because he did not want the Israelites to make Moses’ grave a shrine, present offerings to his spirit, worship him, or attempt to consult his spirit. They may have been prone to these sorts of practices because of their time in Egypt and because of Moses’ stature and his role in mediating Israel’s covenant with God.\nThe Old Testament makes it plain that the dead cannot be contacted (cp. 2 Sam 12:23; Job 14:10-12; Pss 88:10; 115:17). Samuel is the only known exception; God apparently commanded him to return and speak (see 1 Sam 28:12-19). Saul’s sin in consulting a medium was so severe that the Chronicler singles out this failure in commenting on Saul’s downfall (see 1 Chr 10:13-14). There is never any justification for seeking advice from the dead when we have the living word of God to guide us (2 Tim 3:15-17; Heb 4:12-13).\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 19:31; 20:6-8, 27; Deut 18:9-12; 1 Sam 28:1-25; 2 Kgs 21:6; 23:24; 1 Chr 10:13-14; Job 14:10-12; Isa 3:1-3; 8:19-22",

    "content": "Canaanite Religion\nThe Canaanites explained nature by reference to their gods. Each god represented some force of nature. The moon, sun, important stars, and visible planets each were considered a god or goddess. Canaanite deities had two striking features: an extraordinary fluidity of personality, and names whose meanings were related to their function. A few of these gods were particularly influential in the interaction of the Israelites with the Canaanite peoples:\nEl: “the powerful one,” the head of the Canaanite pantheon. El was distant, living far away from Canaan “at the source of the two rivers” (a lingering memory of Eden, perhaps). He presided over a divine council of gods who were his children. In the Old Testament, El (pl. Elohim) is used to speak of God, though the Lord is not identical with the Canaanite deity.\nBaal: “lord,” the great storm god and king of the gods. Baal acted as El’s prime minister and was functionally far more important than El. He was the giver of all fertility. When he died, all vegetation and procreation temporarily ceased. He was the god of justice, the terror of evildoers.\nDagon: “fish” or “grain,” sometimes referred to as the father of Baal. Dagon was the chief god of the Philistine city of Ashdod (1 Sam 5:1-7).\nAshtoreth, Anath, Asherah: the three main goddesses of the Canaanite pantheon, concerned mainly with sex and war. Their primary function was to have sexual relations with Baal on a continual yearly cycle, maintaining Baal’s virility and thus the fertility of the earth.\nThe Canaanites’ personification of the forces of nature accounted for the succession of the seasons. The dry period from April to the end of October represented the duration of Baal’s death after an unsuccessful battle each spring. Commencement of the autumn rains signaled Baal’s revival as the rain and vegetation god, continuing until the following April. The Canaanites believed that the land regained its fertility because of the annual mating of Baal and his female consort, and their own religious activities included imitation of their gods’ behavior.\nThe Canaanites thus worshiped things they felt would benefit them materially. If the gods and goddesses were pleased by the worship, the result would be a plentiful harvest. If a god became angry, animal or human sacrifice might appease the god (see 2 Kgs 3:26-27). Canaanite worship was therefore fundamentally based on fear and manipulation.\nContact among the many religions of the ancient Near East produced not only social tension but also religious borrowing. The Arameans and Philistines who settled in Canaan adopted the practices of the Canaanites; the Amorites similarly incorporated Sumerian religion when they moved into Mesopotamia.\nIsrael’s God, Yahweh, by contrast, demanded exclusive allegiance, and he insisted on worship based on faith rather than manipulative fear. Unfortunately, the Israelites failed to maintain their exclusive monotheism. They adopted pagan thinking and practices, worshiping the Canaanite gods in the Canaanite way, leading to the corruption of their culture and rousing God’s anger. As a result, God brought judgment upon his people, sending them into exile (see 2 Kgs 17:5-23; 24:18–25:21).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 5:1-12",

    "content": "Hostile Authority: David’s Response\nAs David became successful, King Saul became his enemy. The Lord had left Saul as a result of the king’s unfaithfulness, and the anointing of the Spirit now rested on David (1 Sam 15:1–16:14). When Saul needed someone to soothe his mind, he found that David’s harp playing was music to his soul (16:15-23). When Saul needed someone to deal with the ominous threat of Goliath, he found in David a capable and successful young warrior (1 Sam 17). But as others began noticing David and praising his success, Saul became frightened and jealous (18:6-9), and his jealousy soon developed into anger, rage, and murderous hatred.\nAfter Saul tried to kill David with a spear on two occasions (18:10-11), David continued serving him: He led a contingent of the king’s troops (18:13), married the king’s daughter (18:17-27), and served in Saul’s court as a harpist (19:7, 9). But David’s continuing success was too much for the paranoid Saul, who again tried to murder him (19:9-11). David had no choice but to escape (19:11-18; 20:1-42).\nFor the rest of Saul’s reign, David was a fugitive, hunted by the king he had faithfully served. Even then, he refused to harm Saul. On two occasions, David had the opportunity to assassinate Saul (1 Sam 24; 26), but he refused to “attack the Lord’s anointed one” (24:6; 26:9).\nDuring these years as a fugitive, David continued to serve the Lord and the people of Israel (23:1-6; 25:4-9, 14-16; 27:8-9). When news reached David that Saul and Jonathan had been killed, he deeply mourned the death of a “beloved and gracious” king and his son (2 Sam 1:17-27).\nDavid was persistently faithful to a king who hated him and wanted him dead. Similarly, Jeremiah prophesied in the court of kings who burned his words in the fireplace and put him in a cistern to die (Jer 36:21-26; 38:1-13). And Daniel and his friends faithfully served in the court of Babylonian and Persian kings, even when the kings’ decisions were hostile to their faith or to them personally (Dan 3; 6).\nFaithfulness under an enemy in authority doesn’t always bring success. The ultimate example of this is Jesus himself: He was hounded by authorities who eventually succeeded in having him executed. Jesus never “succeeded” in life, but he continued to trust his Father in heaven. Success for Jesus lay beyond death in the Resurrection. It may be the same for some of us: We may die under authorities who hate us without seeing any good come of our suffering. In the age to come, God will right every wrong and will reward the faithfulness of those who suffered under hostile authority.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 24:1-22; 2 Sam 1:1-27; 11:1-27; Jer 36:21-27; 38:1-13; Dan 3:1-30; 6:1-28; John 8:29; Phil 2:6-11; Heb 5:7-10; 1 Pet 2:13–3:7",

    "content": "Celebration\nGod welcomes exuberant expressions of joy and delight from those who worship and praise him (Isa 30:29; Jer 30:19; 31:13; Zeph 3:17; Eph 5:19; Col 3:16).\nDavid’s two attempts to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (2 Sam 6:1-11, 12-23) were marked by celebration. Three Hebrew terms for “danced/dancing” are found in the account of the second procession of the Ark (see also 1 Chr 15:25-29): karar (2 Sam 6:14, 16), pazaz (NLT, “leaping,” 6:16), and raqad (1 Chr 15:29, “skipping about”). All three words refer to vigorous physical expression beyond the meaning of the Hebrew term for “celebrate” used in David’s first attempt (2 Sam 6:5). Thus, in the first procession, David celebrated; in the second procession he engaged in exultant dancing and extravagant merrymaking with intensified musical expression through the addition of shouting and trumpets.\nMusical instruments played a significant role in Temple worship. In 1 Chronicles 25:1-31, David assigned various groups to the ministry of music. Many psalms refer to playing musical instruments in praise and worship of God (see Pss 33:2-3; 57:8; 81:2; 92:1-3; 98:4-6). In Pss 149 and 150, dance and music are combined as a praise offering. Similarly, music and dancing were heard in the father’s house in the parable of the lost son (Luke 15:25), as the son’s return was truly a joyful occasion.\nThe book of Revelation gives a picture of the eternal celebration that awaits the faithful—a celebration characterized by worship in the presence of God (Rev 4:1-11; 5:8-14; 15:1-4). This celebration is described as a wedding feast, in which the bridegroom (Christ) and the bride (his church) are joined together forever (Rev 19:9; see also Matt 22:1-14).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 5:1; 12:17; 15:20-21; 1 Sam 18:6; 2 Sam 6:1-15; 2 Chr 7:6-10; Ezra 3:10-11; Pss 30:11; 69:30; 98:4-6; 107:32; 149:1-9; 150:1-6; Isa 30:29; 54:1; Jer 30:18-19; 31:4, 13; Lam 5:14-15; Zeph 3:17; Luke 15:22-25; 1 Cor 5:8; Eph 5:18-20; Col 3:16; Rev 18:20",

    "content": "God’s Covenant with David\nGod made covenants with his people five times in the Old Testament: (1) when he promised Noah that humanity would never again be destroyed by a flood (Gen 6:18; 9:1-17); (2) when he promised Abraham that he would inherit the land of Canaan and establish a great nation (Gen 15:1-21; 17:1-27); (3) when he formed a unique relationship with Israel at Mount Sinai through Moses (Exod 19–23); (4) when he promised a priestly dynasty to Phinehas (Num 25:10-13); and (5) when he promised a royal dynasty to David (2 Sam 7:4-17). In addition, God promised through Jeremiah to make a “new covenant” in the future (Jer 31:31-34).\nGod’s promise to David is not explicitly identified as a covenant in 2 Samuel 7. However, other passages do identify the event as a covenant (see 23:5; 2 Chr 7:18; 21:7; Pss 89:3-4, 28-29; 132:11-12; Isa 55:3; Jer 33:20-21). God’s promise to David that his “favor will not be taken from him” (2 Sam 7:15) speaks of a covenant relationship. Like God’s promise to Abraham, his covenant with David is unconditional: It does not depend on human obedience or faithfulness but only on God’s unchanging love.\nAt the heart of this covenant is God’s promise to raise up David’s successors forever and to be a father to them (cp. 1 Kgs 11:36; 15:4; 2 Kgs 8:19). God’s blessing on Solomon’s reign is a partial fulfillment of this promise (cp. 2 Sam 7:10-11 with 1 Kgs 8:56; see also 1 Kgs 8:20, 24). God’s patience with the kings of Judah even when they turned away from him was the result of his covenant promise to David (see 1 Kgs 11:12-13; 15:3-5).\nThe complete and final fulfillment of God’s covenant with David is found in the Messiah, Jesus Christ, the “son of David” (e.g., see Matt 9:27; 20:30-31; 21:9, 15). Isaiah foretold of one who would rule “from the throne of his ancestor David for all eternity” (Isa 9:7) and called him the “shoot” growing “out of the stump of David’s family” (Isa 11:1). Both of these references point to the coming Messiah. Four passages in the New Testament teach that Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of the promises made to David by referring directly to 2 Sam 7:1-29 (Luke 1:32-33; Acts 2:29-31; 13:22-23; Heb 1:5). The New Testament opens (Matt 1:1) and closes (Rev 22:16) with reference to Jesus as the son of David, the successor to his throne.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 7:5-16; 1 Kgs 8:20-24; 11:9-13; 15:1-5; 2 Kgs 8:18-19; 2 Chr 7:17-22; Pss 89:3-4, 18-51; 132:10-12; Isa 9:6-7; 11:1-10; Jer 33:20-26; Matt 1:1; 20:30-31; 21:1-9; Luke 1:30-33, 67-79; Acts 2:22-36; Rev 22:16",

    "content": "God or Satan?\nWho is responsible for trials and difficulties? Strangely, Scripture attributes some instances to God, some to Satan, and some to both. How can this be? The difference is one of perspective.\nThere is a notable difference between the accounts of David’s census in Samuel and in Chronicles. Second Samuel 24:1 attributes the census taking to God (“the Lord . . . caused David to harm them by taking a census”), while 1 Chronicles 21:1 attributes the action to Satan (“Satan rose up against Israel and caused David to take a census of the people of Israel”).\nSecond Samuel 24:1-25 tells the census story from God’s perspective as the primary agent; God permitted Satan’s action in order to fulfill his own purpose.\nThis phenomenon is not uncommon in Scripture. Matthew 4:1 contains a similar instance of dual agency, where Jesus is led out into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit to be tempted by the devil. Perhaps the most notable similar experience is Job’s trial: It was brought on by Satan and permitted by God—after the Lord had spoken glowingly about Job (Job 1:6–2:7). Through all the trials that followed, Job’s heart was righteous despite Satan’s attempts to elicit a curse against God. Similarly, 2 Corinthians 12:7 teaches that a God-sent affliction can be delivered by a messenger from Satan. When Paul wrote that he was given a “thorn,” he used a passive verb, indicating that this affliction was given by God.\nSatan works in many ways in an attempt to discourage or destroy God’s people. Yet God is sovereign. God does not author evil, but sometimes God makes use of others’ evil deeds to accomplish his good purposes (Gen 50:20).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 24:1-25; 1 Chr 21:1-30; Job 1:8–2:10; Matt 4:1-11; 12:22-37; Mark 8:31-33; John 13:21-31; Rom 8:28; 1 Cor 5:1-5; 2 Cor 12:6-10; Eph 2:1-7; Rev 20:1-3, 7-10",

    "content": "Jerusalem\nJerusalem was a functioning city as early as four hundred years before the time of David. It was never fully captured during the conquest and the period of the judges (Josh 15:63; Judg 1:8, 21), and peaceful relations were evidently established between the autonomous Jebusite enclave and the surrounding Israelites (Judg 19:10-12). So impregnable was Jerusalem that the Old Testament records only three successful invaders: David, Jehoash (2 Kgs 14:11-14), and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon (2 Kgs 25:1-10).\nWhatever David’s method of capturing Jerusalem (his use of a water tunnel is debatable—see study note on 5:8), he secured Jerusalem as the political, and eventually spiritual, capital of Israel. Psalm 48 speaks beautifully and powerfully of Jerusalem as a fortress. Its towers, bulwarks, and easily defensible citadels with their rugged terrain could produce a false sense of security, if not idolatry. Psalm 48:1-3 reminds the reader that God’s living presence, not the topography of the city, made Jerusalem safe.\nBoth the Old Testament and the New Testament call Jerusalem a “holy city” (see Neh 11:1, 18; Isa 52:1; Dan 9:24; Matt 4:5; 27:53; Rev 21:2). It is the only city so described in the Bible. Wherein lies this city’s holiness? It cannot be a reflection of the holiness of its occupants. In fact, so unholy was the populace that the city was decimated by the Babylonians in 586 BC. Nor was it a holy city because it was Israel’s capital for several centuries. Jerusalem was a holy city, first of all, because God chose it (1 Kgs 8:44, 48; 11:13, 32, 36; 2 Chr 6:5, 34). And because he chose it, he put his glory and his name there (see 1 Kgs 14:21; 2 Chr 12:13; Ezek 8–10; 43:1-27).\nIn the Gospels and Acts, Jerusalem was still a city of great importance. Herod the Great (37–4 BC) had expanded the city and conducted extensive building projects—including the Temple. It remained the center of Israel’s spiritual life (see e.g., Acts 2:46; 3:1-26; 5:12), and many events in the lives of Jesus and his followers occurred in Jerusalem. Jesus had some harsh words for Jerusalem (see Matt 23:37-39)—especially its leadership—and he was eventually put to death there. Jesus warned of impending judgment on the city (see Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:20-24), and his words were actualized in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in AD 70.\nBut the New Testament also introduces the new Jerusalem, the heavenly city comprised of God’s holy people (Heb 11:10; Rev 3:12; 21:2). As the earthly Jerusalem was the sphere in which the glorious presence and reign of God was partially actualized through King David and his successors, the new Jerusalem represents the government of Jesus Christ, the son of David, and his everlasting presence with his people (cp. John 1:14; Rev 21:3).\nPassages for Further Study\nJosh 15:63; Judg 1:8, 21; 2 Sam 5:6-9; 1 Kgs 8:1; 2 Kgs 18:13-17; 25:1-10; 2 Chr 3:1; 12:1-12; 26:9, 15; 32:1-5, 27-30; Ezra 1:1-6; Neh 1:1–6:19; Ps 48:1-3; 125:2; Isa 14:32; 52:1-3; Gal 4:25-26; Heb 12:22-24",

    "content": "God’s Covenant with Israel’s Kings\nSolomon understood his role as David’s successor (1 Kgs 3:7). The aged King David had admonished his son Solomon to keep all of God’s requirements in the law of Moses in order to “be successful in all you do and wherever you go” (2:3). Solomon’s faithfulness would allow the fulfillment of God’s promises to David (1 Kgs 2:4; see 2 Sam 7:5-16). Early in his reign, he consciously emulated his father’s love for and faithfulness to God (1 Kgs 3:3), and he recognized that God had kept his promises to David (8:23-26).\nSeveral times during Solomon’s reign, God himself communicated the inviolability of his covenant with David (3:14; 9:4-5; 11:38). God ultimately judged Solomon and subsequent kings by their faithfulness to that covenant in comparison to David (11:12-13; 14:8; 15:3-5, 11). God’s commendation and blessing or disapproval and judgment were consistently based on whether people kept or violated his law (see Deut 28). During the days of the kings, the people of Israel were condemned for willfully turning away from the clear precepts of the Lord contained in the law and spoken through God’s prophets (2 Kgs 17:13-17). Their rejection of God resulted in judgment (2 Kgs 17:18-23; 21:11-15).\nGod’s dealings with the kings of Israel provide an example for those who are now in covenant with God through Christ. God’s people today are to love the Lord, keep his commandments (John 14:21), and be faithful to him in all things (Matt 25:21; Luke 16:10-12; 2 Tim 3:14; 4:7). Those who follow David’s example of faithfulness will similarly receive God’s praise (see Acts 13:22). Those who confess the name of Jesus, David’s heir (Acts 13:32-37), and who have a heart of devotion to God and his word will seek to live lives that are pure and pleasing to God (see Heb 13:20-21). They look forward to an abundant, eternal inheritance (2 Tim 4:8; Rev 2:10; cp. Gal 5:19-21).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 7:5-17; 1 Kgs 2:2-4; 3:3-15; 8:22-26; 9:1-9; 11:1-13, 29-39; 14:7-16; 15:1-5, 11; 2 Kgs 17:13-23; 21:11-15; Acts 13:21-23",

In response to this unselfish choice, God granted the wisdom he desired (3:12) and the rewards of its proper use (3:13-14; 2 Chr 1:14-17).\nSolomon’s subsequent behavior provided immediate evidence of his wisdom. He resolved an argument over a child with such insight that the people were “in awe of the king” (1 Kgs 3:16-28). Later, the queen of Sheba came to test him with difficult questions and found his wisdom exceeding all that she had heard about it (10:1-9). His administration (4:1-28), his diplomacy (5:1-9), his building projects (5:10–7:51), and his commerce (9:26-28; 10:14-29) all demonstrated his wisdom. Solomon accumulated vast knowledge (4:29-33) and wrote proverbs (much of the book of Proverbs), songs (Pss 72; 127), love poetry (the Song of Songs), and philosophical literature (Ecclesiastes). He used his wisdom to build the Temple (2 Chr 2:12), even as Bezalel had previously been endowed with wisdom to build the Tabernacle (Exod 31:1-3).\nJesus noted Solomon’s great wisdom and reminded his hearers that someone even greater than Solomon was among them (Matt 12:42). Jesus is the true wisdom of God in whom one can find ultimate wisdom (1 Cor 1:24). A life of wisdom is centered in Christ (1 Cor 1:18-25; Col 3:16; 2 Pet 3:18) and in Scripture (2 Tim 3:14-17).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 31:1-6; 1 Kgs 3:5-14; 3:16-28; 4:29-34; 5:2-7; 10:1-13; 2 Chr 1:7-12; Pss 72:1-20; 111:10; 127:1-5; Eccl 12:9-14; Isa 11:1-5; Jer 9:23-24; Matt 12:42; Jas 1:5",

    "content": "Pure Worship\nFrom the beginning of God’s relationship with Israel, he made provision for their worship of him to be pleasing to him (Exod 20–40; Lev 1–8). One of the Lord’s key purposes for his people is that they offer him pure worship.\nWhen Solomon built the Temple as a permanent worship sanctuary, he took great care to erect “a Temple to honor the name of the Lord” (1 Kgs 5:3-5). He built in accordance with the pattern he was given, placing the Ark in the inner sanctuary in the proper manner and dedicating the Temple to the Lord (8:1-11; see Deut 16:13-17). In all of this, Solomon kept the requirements laid down in the law (see, e.g., Exod 25:10-22), which were intended to keep Israel’s worship purely focused on the Lord and his word.\nUnfortunately, people tend to worship according to their own inclinations rather than according to God’s instructions, and Israel was no different. In his later years, Solomon turned away from the Lord to other gods (1 Kgs 11:4-8). After Solomon’s death, Jeroboam established a competing, idolatrous religion in the northern kingdom, in clear violation of God’s law (14:9-10, 15-16). False worship characterized the northern kingdom throughout its history (e.g., 15:26; 16:13, 25-26, 30-33; 21:25-26). Meanwhile, in Judah, the southern kingdom, tolerance for local pagan altars became a persistent spiritual distraction (15:14; 22:43). Neither Judah nor Israel remained pure in their worship of the Lord.\nThere is one God, and God’s people must worship only him (1 Kgs 8:23; see Deut 5:7, 9; 6:4; John 14:6; Acts 4:12). Our worship must come from a pure heart; we must remain completely faithful to the Lord in dedicated service to him (1 Kgs 15:14; 17:1; see Deut 10:12, 20; Ps 24:3-4; Matt 4:10; John 4:24). Our daily and weekly worship of God should have a sense of God’s presence, which will be a source of genuine joy (1 Kgs 8:56; cp. Ps 63:1-3; Phil 4:4). Just as Israel’s Temple was a sanctuary intended to attract all people (1 Kgs 8:41-43), believers, who are the temple of the living God (1 Cor 3:16-17), are to live so as to attract and motivate others to desire to know the Lord and worship him (Matt 5:16; Acts 2:40-47; 2 Tim 4:5; 1 Pet 2:12). Our whole lives should include daily worship of Christ, acknowledging him as Lord (1 Pet 3:15). And we must not let any idol take God’s place in our hearts (1 Jn 5:21).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 8:20; Exod 4:31; 25:10-22; Lev 1:1–8:36; Deut 5:7-9; 6:4-9; 10:12, 20; 16:13-17; 26:1-15; 1 Kgs 5:3-5; Pss 24:3-6; 51:1-19; Hos 6:6; 14:1-2; Mic 6:6-8; Matt 4:10; 5:16; 6:1-18; John 4:19-24; 5:23; 14:6; Acts 2:40-47; Rom 12:1-2; 1 Cor 3:16-17; 14:1-40; Phil 3:3; Heb 10:1-25; 1 Pet 3:15; 1 Jn 5:21; Rev 5:9-13; 15:3",

    "content": "The Land\nLand is extremely important to a largely agrarian society such as ancient Israel. Israel was given the privilege and responsibility of living in the land of Canaan, as a key provision of God’s covenant with them (1 Kgs 8:33-40; see also Deut 28). The land was part of Israel’s relationship with God: God had promised this land to Abraham and his descendants (Gen 12:1-3; 13:14-17). The nation of Israel lived in the land as its custodians and earthly possessors. The land was Israel’s “special possession” (Deut 4:21), given by God, who required their fidelity (Deut 4:40). God expected the people to be proper stewards of the land and to serve him faithfully.\nUnfortunately, God’s people turned to their own ways, serving pagan gods and themselves (2 Kgs 17:7-17). So God allowed foreign nations to gradually take away Israel’s ownership of the land (e.g., 2 Kgs 8:20-22; 13:1-3; 17:3). Eventually, Assyria launched a full-scale invasion of the northern kingdom, sending the Israelites into exile (17:5-6, 22-23). Through these events God warned the people of Judah, the southern kingdom, that if they, too, failed to respond, they would forfeit their land (2 Kgs 21:8). Sadly, they refused to listen (2 Kgs 21:9), and their unfaithfulness eventually resulted in expulsion from the land at the hands of the Babylonians (25:1-21).\nIsrael’s rebellion and failure to properly manage the land that God entrusted to them serves as a warning to us. God has redeemed us in Christ Jesus so that we may live faithful and productive lives (John 15:16; Eph 2:4-10). Our infidelity and lack of productivity may cause us to lose our place of service for Christ (John 15:1-2, 6). It is by abiding in him that we “produce much fruit” and grow in our faith (John 15:5).\nGod’s people always have a propensity to sin (see Rom 3:23; 1 Jn 1:8, 10). Nevertheless, God always stands ready to forgive and restore those who turn back to him (see 1 Jn 1:9) and to reinstate the blessings of his covenant. The one who mediates the new covenant between God and his people (Matt 26:27-28) is also their advocate in heaven (1 Jn 2:1). In the end, those who remain faithful to God will inherit the blessings of the new heaven and the new earth (1 Pet 1:3-5; Rev 21:1-7).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:1-3; 13:14-17; Lev 26:1-46; Deut 28:1-68; 1 Kgs 8:29-51; 9:3-9; 2 Kgs 17:18-23; Pss 24:1; 89:11; 1 Pet 1:4; Rev 21:1-7",

    "content": "God’s Faithfulness to His People\nWhen God established the covenant with his people Israel, it included blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (see Deut 28:1-68). Many years later, when Solomon had finished dedicating the Temple, the Lord appeared to him and reminded him that if the people were unfaithful to this covenant, sure judgment would follow (1 Kgs 9:6-9). Conversely, if they were faithful, God would dwell among them and never forsake them (6:12-13).\nGod had called the nation Israel to be his covenant people (Exod 19:5-6; 1 Kgs 8:53). Despite this unique identity, the people of Israel were frequently rebellious toward God (see, e.g., Exod 32:1-6; Num 14:1-12; Judg 2:10-15). Even during the height of God’s blessing of Israel (Solomon’s reign) the people “sacrificed their offerings at local places of worship” (3:2), an expression of their ongoing commitment to pagan worship (see also 1 Kgs 11:4-13). Both the northern and southern kingdoms later fell into this sin (12:31-32; 13:2, 32-33; 14:22-24; 15:14; 22:43). Every ruler of the northern kingdom led the people into apostate religious practices, resulting in Israel being sent into exile in 722 BC. While the southern kingdom experienced occasional religious reform, such reform would only be temporary, and Judah would ultimately suffer a similar fate in being exiled by the Babylonians in 586 BC. Still, God retained a faithful remnant among his people (see, e.g., 1 Kgs 19:18; Isa 10:20-34) and had plans for their future well-being (see Isa 4:2-6; Isa 40:1-11; Jer 30:1-24). In spite of his people’s unfaithfulness, God maintained his love and faithfulness toward them and desired to restore them (Hos 2:1-23).\nGod still has a people who are his own (1 Cor 1:2; 1 Pet 1:1). Those who follow Christ are his “chosen people” (1 Pet 2:9-10, who constitute the temple of God (2 Cor 6:14–7:1). They have God’s promise that he will never forsake them but will always be faithful to his promises to them (John 14:16; 2 Tim 2:13).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 32:10; Exod 3:13-17; 34:6; Deut 7:9; 31:6; Josh 1:5; 21:45; 2 Sam 7:16; 1 Kgs 6:12-13; 8:29-53; 9:3-9; Pss 31:1-5; 91:4; Isa 40:1-11; 54:8; Lam 3:22-24; Mic 7:18-20; John 14:16; Rom 3:3-4; 11:25-29; 1 Cor 10:13; 2 Cor 1:20; 2 Tim 2:13; Titus 1:2; Heb 10:23; 11:11; 1 Pet 4:19; Rev 1:4-5; 19:11",

    "content": "True Success\nGod requires complete devotion from his people (Deut 6:4-6; cp. Matt 22:37). True success comes from seeking God and acknowledging him as sovereign (Matt 6:33), to the exclusion of all idols (1 Jn 5:21). For the people of Israel, success was directly tied to their obedience to God’s covenant (see Lev 26:1-46; Deut 28:1-68). The spiritual condition of Israel and its leaders had a dramatic impact on whether or not they would continue to receive God’s favor and maintain possession of the Promised Land.\nThe author of 1–2 Kings introduces each ruler’s reign with a spiritual evaluation, often comparing each king’s devotion to God with the precedent set by David (see 1 Kgs 11:38; 14:8; 15:3-5, 11). The narrative of these books demonstrates that the fate of both Israel and Judah hangs on the spiritual leadership of their kings. The continued success of God’s people in the land of Canaan was predicated on the faithful worship of God (see Deut 12:4-7). Allowing worship at local pagan shrines is repeatedly singled out for disapproval (see, e.g., 3:2-4; 11:7).\nBeginning with Jeroboam I, the kings of Israel (the northern kingdom) uniformly practiced apostate religion and were censured for practicing it (12:31-32; 13:33-34; 15:25-26, 33-34; 16:11-13, 25-26). Of these kings, King Ahab was the most wicked (16:30-33; 21:25-26), and his son Ahaziah closely followed his example and is denounced for his idolatrous ways (22:51-53). The kings of the northern kingdom set their people on a course doomed for destruction (2 Kgs 17:21-23). Despite God’s repeated efforts to get his people’s attention (2 Kgs 17:13-15, 23), they failed to respond, so God invoked the penalties for persistent spiritual infidelity (see 1 Kgs 13:33-34).\nSome of the kings of Judah (the southern kingdom) receive commendation, but many of them are denounced as well. Rehoboam allowed pagan worship to spread in Judah (14:22-24), and Abijam continued in his father’s sins (15:3). Even the good kings Asa and Jehoshaphat receive criticism for letting popular local worship sites continue (see 15:14; 22:43). Failure to give God his rightful place had disastrous results.\nWhile the kings and people of the northern kingdom foolishly pursued their own way, people who instead fear the Lord and live by the standards of God’s word will be blessed and find genuine contentment (Pss 33:12; 119:1-2; 144:15). True success is always found in acknowledging and trusting God to be king of one’s life (Matt 6:33). And as both Jesus and his early followers demonstrate, success is not necessarily characterized by material blessing and wealth. Joy and peace are ultimately found in being at the center of God’s will and in grasping the hope we have in him (see Phil 3:8-14; 1 Pet 4:12-19).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 6:1-8; 12:4-7; Josh 1:7-8; 1 Sam 18:14; 1 Kgs 11:38; 12:26-33; 13:1-3, 33-34; 14:8-11; 2 Kgs 17:13-23; Pss 33:12; 119:1-2; 144:15; Matt 6:33; Luke 10:25-28; 1 Jn 5:21",

    "content": "Prophets in 1 Kings\nGod’s prophets played a major role in the Old Testament kingdoms of Israel and Judah. They ministered to people’s everyday needs, confronted kings and priests over their apostasy, and performed many miracles. They brought announcements of God’s coming plans (1 Kgs 11:29-32; 17:1), especially messages of judgment (13:1-2; 20:42; 21:20-23; 22:20-22).\nSeveral examples from 1 Kings serve to illustrate the prophets’ role. The faithful prophet Nathan, who had rebuked David regarding his sin with Bathsheba (2 Sam 12:1-12), played a crucial role in counteracting Adonijah’s attempt to seize his father David’s throne (1 Kgs 1:5-49). The prophet Ahijah informed Jeroboam that God intended to divide Solomon’s kingdom after his death (11:29-39). Later, God used an unnamed prophet to condemn Jeroboam’s apostate religion and the altar at Bethel (13:1-10) and to demonstrate the consequences of disobeying the Lord’s commission (13:11-32). Ahijah reappeared, announcing the Lord’s judgment against Jeroboam and his heirs (14:1-16). The prophet Jehu announced judgment on King Baasha for continuing in Jeroboam’s sin (16:1-4). Finally, a large portion of 1 Kings is devoted to the prophet Elijah (17:1–19:21; 21:17-28), who was God’s primary spokesman during King Ahab’s reign (though other prophets were also active during this period; see 20:38-43; 22:17-28).\nThe prophets in 1 Kings received varied reception from the kings of Israel and Judah. The wisdom of listening to God’s prophets is highlighted throughout the narrative, as is the danger of rejecting the prophets and their message. Through his spokesmen, the prophets, God sought to prevent the catastrophes that were forthcoming based on the disobedience of the people. Unfortunately, many of the kings failed to listen to and heed the prophets, thereby bringing about the devastation that had been forewarned.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 11:29-39; 13:1-32; 14:1-16; 16:2-4; 17:1–18:46; 19:1-21; 20:35-43; 21:17-28; 22:10-28; 2 Kgs 17:13-15",

The New Testament offers numerous warnings about the eternal consequences of unrepented sinful behavior (1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Rev 22:15).\nThe sinful acts of God’s people are prominent throughout the late monarchical period. Words such as sin, evil, and wicked appear frequently to assert that the kings of both Israel (2 Kgs 3:2; 13:2, 11; 14:24; 15:9, 18, 24, 28; 17:2) and Judah (8:18, 27; 21:2, 16, 20; 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19) did “what was evil in the Lord’s sight.”\nThe northern kingdom was particularly culpable. Its kings and people were uniformly condemned for their godless ways (17:16-17, 22); the basic sin of apostate worship, introduced by Jeroboam I, continued in Israel until the end (10:29; 17:21-23; 23:15). God repeatedly warned the people through his prophets (17:13) and brought the chastisement of foreign invaders (13:3, 7). Nothing moved the Israelites’ hearts, for they were set in their ways (13:6; 17:14-17). Eventually God allowed foreign invaders to defeat them and occupy their land, sending many into exile (17:18, 20-23).\nThe people of Judah were not innocent either. Many of their kings were guilty of gross wickedness, and Judean society grew increasingly apostate and followed “the evil practices that Israel had introduced” (17:19). Despite God’s repeated acts of kindness (e.g., 19:32-36) and warnings delivered through his prophets (21:8-15), the people persisted in their sin, and God’s judgment once again fell (21:10-15; 23:26-27; 24:1-4; 25:1-21).\nWhere there is genuine repentance, God will graciously forgive his people and remit the penalty. But how much better to be faithful to God’s Word (2 Kgs 18:5-6; 23:25; Ps 119:9-11, 33-37; 2 Tim 4:7; Rev 2:10), so that God’s blessings (Ps 112:1; 119:1-2; 144:15) might bring success (2 Kgs 18:7; see also 2 Chr 26:4-5; Prov 3:1-10; 2 Cor 3:5). God’s people need to give God first place in their lives (1 Kgs 18:21, 36-39; see Deut 6:13; 10:12-13; Mic 6:8; Matt 6:33), pray for God’s persevering grace (Ps 19:13), and let the word of God be their guide (Ps 119:9; Col 3:16; 2 Tim 3:16).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 18:20-21; Exod 34:7; Lev 26:14-46; Num 15:30-31; Deut 31:16-18; 1 Kgs 8:46-51; 2 Kgs 8:18, 27; 2 Kgs 13:1-7; 14:23-24; 17:13-23; 18:9-12; 21:8-16; 23:25-27; 24:1-3, 19–25:21; 2 Chr 7:14; 33:12-13; Ps 119:9-11, 33-37; Jer 44:2-6; Mic 6:8; Matt 6:33; Col 3:16; 2 Tim 3:16; 4:7; Rev 2:10",

    "content": "God’s Judgment of His People\nAlthough the kings of Israel and Judah had a major role in the history of the divided kingdom, the people also played a part in what occurred. As they followed their wicked rulers (2 Kgs 3:3; 17:22; 21:9, 11, 16), their own hearts strayed from God (12:3; 14:4; 15:4, 35; 17:9-11; 18:4; 22:17). They participated in the religious practices initiated by Jeroboam I (10:28-31; 17:21-22) and worshiped at pagan shrines (12:3; 14:4; 15:4, 35; 18:4).\nSometimes during this period, God’s people are portrayed positively. The people of Judah rejoiced over the removal of Athaliah and the installation of Joash as king (11:12, 18-20). At times, the people were instrumental in the succession of kings (14:21; 23:30) or were responsive to godly leadership (11:17; 18:36; 23:1-3, 21-23).\nYet despite God’s repeated warnings through his prophets (17:13), the people of both kingdoms became set in their apostasy (17:14-19, 22). So God’s righteous wrath burned against them and their leaders, and he brought his threatened judgment upon them (17:22-23; 21:10-15; 22:17; 23:26-27; 24:20; 25:21). God acted in accordance with the stipulations in his covenant with them (Lev 26:27-39), even though he loved his people and longed to restore them (see Hos 11:1-11).\nGod never gave up caring for his people. He rescued them from Sennacherib (2 Kgs 18:17–19:37) and promised that a remnant would again thrive in the land (19:30-31). Even the good treatment Jehoiachin received in Babylon (25:27-30) no doubt renewed hope among the repentant of God’s people. God promised to one day restore his people from exile and give them fellowship with him in the land once again, ruling over them through his chosen king, the descendant of David (Jer 23:3-6; see also Isa 11; Rom 11:5-36).\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 26:27-39; 2 Kgs 17:7-23; 21:9-16; 23:26-27; 24:20–25:21; Ps 62:12; Prov 11:31; Isa 3:10-11; Jer 1:16; 17:10; 23:3-6; Ezek 7:1-9; 33:18-20; 34:17-24; 39:23-24; Hos 11:1-11; Amos 3:2; Matt 25:24-30; Luke 12:47-48; 13:6-9; John 5:45-47; Rom 11:5-36; Col 3:23-25; Heb 12:25; Jas 2:12-13; 1 Pet 1:17; Rev 2:1–3:22",

    "content": "Seeking the Lord\nAs Israel was on the verge of entering the Promised Land, Moses instructed the people to “seek the Lord . . . at the place of worship he himself will choose from among all the tribes” (Deut 12:5). The Israelites were to rid the land of pagan worship practices and establish the centrality of the worship of God. In the wilderness, they constructed the Tabernacle as the place where God would manifest his presence and where the people would come to worship him. Once they were settled in the Promised Land, they were to build a more permanent sanctuary.\nDuring the period of the judges, the people of Israel often sought the gods of the surrounding nations rather than the one true God. The establishment of the monarchy brought the hope that the entire nation would be unified in the worship of God. However, the first king, Saul, lost the kingdom and his life in part because he sought a medium rather than the Lord (1 Chr 10:13-14). Many of the kings throughout Israel’s history would follow Saul’s example of disobedience and would lead the nation into pagan religious practices.\nDavid, by contrast, was a man after the Lord’s own heart (1 Sam 13:14). As king, one of David’s chief concerns was to restore the prominence of the Ark of the Covenant, which the Israelites had neglected in the days of Saul (1 Chr 13:3). David failed in his first attempt to bring the Ark to Jerusalem because he and the Levites did not seek the Lord’s counsel regarding its transport (13:1-14; 15:13). David later brought the Ark to Jerusalem successfully (15:1–16:1).\nThe sanctuary and worship in Jerusalem provided a crucial component in seeking the Lord. Once the Ark was situated in the tent prepared for it in Jerusalem, David established a new role for Levites as ministers of music (16:4-6). And David consistently exhorted the leaders to “seek the Lord” in building the Temple (22:19; cp. 28:8-10). Solomon’s first act to consolidate the kingdom was to gather all the leaders together at the altar at Gibeon in order to seek the Lord (2 Chr 1:1-6). The Lord met Solomon there to grant him both wisdom and wealth like that of no other king. Later, Solomon completed the Temple and dedicated it as a place for seeking the Lord (2 Chr 6).\nIsaiah the prophet urged those waiting for the fulfillment of God’s promises to seek God: “Seek the Lord while you can find him. Call on him now while he is near” (Isa 55:6). God’s covenant and promise are certain (Isa 55:3), and they are reserved for those who seek the Lord.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Chr 10:13-14; 13:3; 16:11-13; 22:19; 28:8-10; 2 Chr 6:19-40; 7:14; Pss 27:4-8; 105:4-6; Isa 55:6-7; Jer 29:13-14; Matt 6:31-33; Rom 2:7",

    "content": "The Promise of Dynasty\nGod promised David that his dynasty would last forever (2 Sam 7:11-16 // 1 Chr 17:9-14). Yet the Chronicler lived at a time when David’s dynasty had apparently ended. Although David’s line of descent continued (see 1 Chr 3:1-24), no descendant of David had been king since the exile of Judah to Babylon over 150 years earlier. As a result, Israel’s hope for the future was in question. The Chronicler wanted to show that God’s promise to David was unconditional and that his throne was indeed “secure forever.” Even the possibility of exile does not remove the hope of God’s promise of a dynasty. The promise would continue for a future time because a future descendant of David would inherit the throne (17:11).\nThe Chronicler’s hope was not directly “messianic” in the strict sense—he was not primarily focused on the arising of an anointed deliverer. His continuing hope was that the covenant community would again be led by kings descended from David. The Chronicler encouraged the community to look to the future for a new king to improve Israel’s condition.\nWith the birth of Jesus, the Son of David, the Chronicler’s hope for the community of Israel was finally realized. Jesus is the fulfillment of the Chronicler’s expectation of a new king (see Matt 1:1-17). His Kingdom is for all the nations (Isa 49:6), stretching “from sea to sea and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth” (Zech 9:10).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 49:8-12; 1 Chr 5:1-2; 17:1-15; 22:6-13; 28:4-7; Pss 78:67-72; 132:11-12; Amos 9:11-12; Matt 1:1-17; 22:41-46",

    "content": "Temple Worship\nThroughout the ancient Near East, it was a king’s responsibility to provide for his nation’s temple. David, the founder of the dynasty of Judah’s kings, established Jerusalem as the capital of Israel (2 Sam 5:4-10) and made it the central place of worship. Although Solomon actually built the Temple, David prepared for the building of the Temple and for its liturgy.\nIt took Solomon seven years to build the Temple in Jerusalem, beginning in the fourth year of his reign (967 BC). It was a large structure—90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high, with a vestibule 15 feet deep stretching across the width (see 1 Kgs 6:2-10). It employed the most sophisticated building techniques of the age, and no expense was spared in construction, ornamentation, or equipment. Even so, Solomon readily confessed to its utter inadequacy to house the eternal God (1 Kgs 8:27).\nThe Temple, located adjacent to the king’s palace, represented God’s reign over all creation and all nations: “The Lord is in his holy Temple. Let all the earth be silent before him” (Hab 2:20). It served to teach Israel about God’s exclusive dominion and their total dependence on him. And although God cannot be confined to a building, he chose to make the Temple the focal point of his presence on earth. As such, the Temple was central for Israelite worship and for the personal relationship between God and his people.\nThe kings were charged to devote themselves to God and to encourage the proper worship of God at his dwelling place, the Temple (see 1 Chr 22:17-19). The Temple also established the legitimacy of the human king, who represented divine rule. This role of the Temple was expressed in Psalm 132, which celebrated David’s restoration of the Ark to Jerusalem (Ps 132:6-12). This psalm was used at the conclusion of Solomon’s prayer of dedication (2 Chr 6:41-42).\nThe Temple’s purpose in representing God’s presence in the world was later fulfilled in Christ and the church. Jesus himself signaled the transition from the Temple buildings to his own body as the temple (see John 2:19), and the disciples began understanding this transition after the resurrection (John 2:21-22). The apostle Paul later described the church as the new sacred space where Jews and Gentiles are reconciled. Using Temple imagery, he described breaking down barriers in the body of Christ, creating one people (Eph 2:14-15). The church stands as a holy temple, resting on the foundation of the apostles and prophets (Eph 2:20-22). It is built from living stones—believers—fashioned together around Jesus Christ, the cornerstone (1 Pet 2:4-5).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 8:27-53; 1 Chr 22:1-19; 2 Chr 5:2-14; 6:41-42; 7:12-16; Ps 48:9; 65:4; 66:13; 138:2; Jer 7:3-11; 11:15; Ezek 8:6-16; 44:1-31; Joel 1:14; 2:17; Hab 2:20; Hag 2:7; John 2:19-22; Eph 2:14-15, 20-22; 1 Pet 2:4-5",

    "content": "God’s Promised Kingdom\nGod promised that his kingdom would come through David (1 Chr 17:4-14). During his reign, David himself made preparations for the building of the Temple as the focal point of God’s kingdom (28:11-19). He also appealed to Israel’s leaders to seek the Lord (28:8-10), and he encouraged the community of Israel to “be strong and courageous” in trusting God to provide (28:20-21).\nThe Chronicler used these words of David to appeal to the citizens of Judea after the Exile to keep the hope of God’s kingdom alive. The Chronicler wanted the people to know that God’s promise to David, confirmed to Solomon, was equally confirmed for them. After the Exile, Judah no longer existed as an independent kingdom ruled by the dynasty of David. Instead, Judea stood as a small territory with limited independence under a Persian governor. Yet the community of Judea could experience God’s blessing, just as the people had in the days of Hezekiah and Josiah. The Chronicler did not know exactly how God’s promise to David would be realized. Yet he had complete trust in God’s power, sovereignty, and justice; he knew that God would be faithful to his promise and that his kingdom would eventually rule over all.\nFollowing the time of the Chronicler, it appeared that his hopes were disappointed. The Greeks replaced the Persians as rulers of Israel; their intolerance for the Jewish community of faith reached its zenith in the tyrannical Antiochus IV “Epiphanes” (175–163 BC), who made every effort to destroy Israel’s faith and identity, as Daniel had foreseen (Dan 11:21-39). The priestly family of Maccabees resisted Antiochus, restored the Temple, and preserved Judea’s identity. But then the community disintegrated under the successors to the Maccabees; Israel fractured into sects (e.g., the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes) and eventually came under Roman control. When Jesus was born, Roman governors controlled the territory of Israel.\nThe fulfillment of God’s promises to David took place in a way the Chronicler did not anticipate. Jesus was the anointed king, the Messiah from the dynasty of David (see Matt 16:16-17). His Kingdom was not established by the military defeat of the Romans but rather by the defeat of the powers of sin and death. His Kingdom continues to spread through his followers, and the powers of hell will never prevail against it. In the end, His Kingdom will be fully realized in the ultimate defeat of the powers of evil, and He will reign as King forever (see Rev 19:11–20:15).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Chr 17:9-14; 28:1-21; Isa 2:1-4; 60:1-22; 65:17-25; Ezek 37:21-28; Dan 2:31-45; 7:1-28; Mic 4:1-5; Zech 9:9-10; 14:1-21; Matt 4:17; 6:33; 13:11-50; 16:16-19; 18:3-4, 23-35; 19:14, 23-30; 20:1-16; 22:2-14; 25:1-46; Luke 1:30-33; Eph 5:5; Rev 19:1–21:27",

    "content": "God’s Name on His Temple\nIn his prayer of dedication, Solomon declared that the Temple was the house where God’s name would be present (2 Chr 6:20; cp. 6:5-6). God had promised David that he would place his own name on the Temple in Jerusalem (2 Sam 7:4-17). When God puts his name in a place, it signifies his possession of it.\nFor the people of Israel, the Temple embodied the land God promised to them and marked by his name. It was the ultimate symbol of God’s relationship with Israel. So Solomon prayed that God would remember his relationship with Israel and hear their prayers at this Temple. Solomon’s prayer uses God’s personal name (Lord=Yahweh; see Exod 3:13-15) to make the Temple the definitive symbol of Israel’s faith. The Temple was the chosen place where the covenant was preserved, where the people of Israel called on God’s name and acknowledged God in confession and praise.\nThe fulfillment of God’s promise to put his name on his Temple is now to be found in the “living temple,” the community of God’s people. Peter urges believers to come “to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God’s temple. He was rejected by people, but he was chosen by God for great honor. And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple. What’s more, you are his holy priests. Through the mediation of Jesus Christ, you offer spiritual sacrifices that please God” (1 Pet 2:4-5). God’s name rests on his church as it did on his Temple.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 3:13-15; 2 Sam 7:12-13; 2 Chr 6:3-42; Ps 23:3; 1 Pet 2:4-5",

    "content": "God’s Plan to Restore\nOne of the best known verses in Chronicles lays out God’s plan for Israel: “Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land” (2 Chr 7:14). This verse expresses the Chronicler’s understanding of how God works with his people. The concept has been described as a “theology of immediate retribution”: Each person experiences the consequences for obedience or failure within his or her own lifetime.\nThe vocabulary of this verse (humble, pray, turn, seek, heal) appears repeatedly in the Chronicler’s writing as he shows this principle operating in the lives of the kings of Judah. The celebration of Passover during Hezekiah’s reign provides one of the most prominent examples. In the very first month of his reign, Hezekiah began to restore the Temple (29:3). He extended an invitation to all Israel (including the people of the northern kingdom) to attend the Passover festival at Jerusalem (30:1). When Hezekiah’s messengers urged the people to turn to the Lord (30:6), many from the north humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem (30:11). So many people arrived that the Judeans could not accommodate them, and those from the north were not ready (ritually) to observe the Passover. Hezekiah prayed for the people as they resolved to seek the Lord (30:18-19). The Lord indeed healed the people (30:20), and they all were able to participate. The festival was going so well that it was extended another seven days (30:23). Hezekiah followed the very principles that Solomon had enunciated in his prayer. Manasseh provides another encouraging example of God’s redemption at work (33:11-23).\nThose familiar with Chronicles would have understood well the preaching of John the Baptist as he called for repentance and healing (Matt 3:5-12). Failure to repent will result in judgment. But there is no situation beyond the reach of redemption for those willing to humble themselves before God.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Chr 7:13-15; 12:5-12; 14:1-7; 15:1-19; 25:14-28; 26:5, 16; 29:3–31:21; 32:24-26; 33:10-17; 34:3-33; Matt 3:5-12; Rom 5:8-11, 19-21",

    "content": "God’s Inscrutable Purposes in History\nGod directs people and events to fulfill his purposes in history. He has no need to explain himself, but he always has a purpose that he is working out; he guides individuals, nations, and events in accord with his will. This philosophy of history remains consistent throughout biblical history. God works through human actions to bring about results that he has planned and that cannot be explained in any other way except his orchestration.\nFor example, the Chronicler gives just one explanation for the continued division of the kingdom of Israel: Rehoboam and those loyal to him “obeyed the message of the Lord and did not fight against Jeroboam” (2 Chr 11:4). The cause of the division—the irrational response of Rehoboam to the people’s request—has already been explained in the previous narrative: “This turn of events was the will of God, for it fulfilled the Lord’s message to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh” (10:15). Rehoboam may have been able to easily defeat the rebels, but he was deterred by the will of the Lord.\nObedience to God’s will brought positive results for Rehoboam: He fortified cities; he put military leaders, equipment, and food supplies in place; loyal citizens migrated to his territory; and he had a large family. God’s will was clear, and the benefit to Rehoboam was obvious, yet the Chronicler could not explain God’s purposes. Readers of the book today are also left to ponder why God allowed the kingdom to remain divided.\nThe prophet Isaiah declares the mystery of God’s ways: “‘My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts,’ says the Lord. ‘And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine. For just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts’” (Isa 55:8-9). Those who fear God learn not to lean on human understanding, but to follow the word of God even when it is contrary to earthly values.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 8:56-61; 2 Chr 10:1–11:4; Job 42:1-6; Ps 115:1-3; Isa 40:9-31; 42:1-17; 55:8-13; Rom 8:26-30; Eph 1:9-14",

    "content": "Trusting in Human Strength\nGod had repeatedly displayed his power to his people throughout their history. He took a barren elderly couple and made them the progenitors of a great nation. He rescued this nation from the clutches of the powerful tyrant, Egypt. He performed numerous miracles in preserving them in the wilderness. And he had secured victory over their enemies many times during the conquest, the period of the judges, and the monarchical period. Yet, throughout their history, the people of Israel demonstrated a lack of trust in the Lord, instead opting to trust in human strength.\nOn one occasion, Asa, king of Judah, sought help from the king of Aram—a perennial enemy of God’s people—giving him the treasures of the Temple and palace so he would attack Baasha, king of Israel (2 Chr 16:1-6). The prophet Hanani chastised Asa, seeing in Aram a human foe who would continue to be a nemesis to the kingdom of Judah. Previous battles demonstrated that God was the only ally Asa needed (16:8).\nAsa’s reliance on the king of Aram revealed a much deeper spiritual problem. Asa forgot that “the eyes of the Lord search the whole earth” (16:9; see also Zech 4:10). So when Hanani confronted Asa with the error of his ways, Asa summarily threw the prophet into confinement, and the angry king arbitrarily inflicted cruelties on the people (2 Chr 16:10).\nAsa provides a sad example of the human propensity to rely on one’s own tangible resources (see Prov 11:7; Isa 31:1; Jer 17:5-6) and to become angry when corrected. Even those who experience the power of the Lord in a very tangible fashion often have this leaning; this was quite true of the generation of Israelites who had been rescued by God from slavery in Egypt. It is much better to rely on the Lord and welcome his direction (cp. Pss 33:18; 37:7; Isa 50:10; Jer 17:7-8; Acts 13:43). Life is a long lesson in trusting God; we might begin by doing what is good and right (2 Chr 14:1-6), but our legacy is not settled until the last deed is done (see Rom 2:6-11; 1 Cor 4:1-5). Faithfulness to the Kingdom of God must not be compromised by personal ambitions.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 13:4; 2 Kgs 6:15-18; 2 Chr 16:1-10; 32:7-8; Pss 20:6-8; 37:3-7; 60:11-12; Prov 11:7-8; 18:10-12; Eccl 3:14; Isa 31:1-5; Jer 17:5-8; Matt 10:26-31; Rom 2:6-11; 1 Cor 4:1-5; Rev 2:8-11",

    "content": "God as Holy Warrior\nThe Arabic term jihad, which has become well known in the English language, speaks of a “holy war” in which men fight for God. However, the biblical description of a “holy war” is quite different. A holy war is a conflict where God fights for his people while they trust in him. In these wars, victory does not depend on weapons but on obedience to God.\nIn a time of war, King Jehoshaphat of Judah proclaimed a fast (2 Chr 20:3) and petitioned God in the typical style of a prayer lament (20:5-12), which included an invocation, a complaint, a confession of trust, and a request. Jehoshaphat and the people reflected their hearts’ attitude by bowing low with their faces to the ground (20:18). The image of an army marching into battle headed by a choir giving praise to God (20:21) is startling, because the battlefield is not usually the place for worship and praise. However, worship provides a way to know the will of God, and it invites God to act to save his people. God rewards acts of trust in him, and in Jehoshaphat’s case, God brought about the defeat of a large coalition of enemy forces without Israel having to even draw their swords (20:22-24).\nThe New Testament portrays Jesus as the conqueror of all the principalities and powers that are arrayed against the Kingdom of God (see Eph 1:19-21). In the end, Jesus will accomplish the ultimate defeat of all enemy forces (1 Cor 15:24-28; Rev 19:11–20.15). In bringing this ultimate victory of God as king, worship will be complete: “Praise the Lord! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns” (Rev 19:6).\nPassages for Further Study\nJosh 6:1-20; 10:7-15; Judg 7:7-22; 2 Kgs 19:14-37; 2 Chr 6:34-35; 20:5-7, 20-24; Isa 26:21–27:6; Jon 3:4-10; Matt 16:18; 2 Cor 10:3-6; Eph 1:19-23; 6:10-20; Rev 19:11-21",

    "content": "Violation of the Sacred\nEver since Eden, humans have attempted to take God’s sacred space as their own (Gen 2:15-17; 3:1-6). Scripture shows us God’s anger and swift punishment when people treat his holy commands with contempt or casual disdain. Nadab and Abihu were supposed to lead Israel in proper worship, so when they ignored God’s specific instructions about priestly duties, they lost their lives for their sin (Lev 10:1-20). Jesus himself expressed the righteous anger of God when he entered the Temple with a whip and drove out the merchants and money changers who were defiling the holy space for their own profit (John 2:13-16).\nThere can be no violations with respect to God’s holy presence, and that certainly included the Temple in Jerusalem. The Temple represented God’s presence in creation, so all of its rituals needed to reflect its status as sacred and set apart for God alone. This meant that no one could enter it to make offerings except those anointed for the task.\nOne particularly egregious sin was when King Uzziah entered the Temple to burn incense (2 Chr 26:16). The kings of Israel (unlike kings of other ancient Near Eastern cultures) were excluded from the sacred space because they were anointed only for the secular function of government. The king of Israel was not a priest. He was not God’s representative in sacred matters nor (as in other cultures) a god himself. He was a servant of God taken from among his brothers to administer the covenant in the community (Deut 17:18-20). So when King Uzziah tried to claim a priestly function that was not rightfully his, he violated the sanctuary that God had set apart for his own presence. In terms of the function of the Temple, this violation was no trivial matter.\nDavid provides a counterpoint to Uzziah’s arrogance (1 Sam 21:1-9). When his men were hungry, he knew they could find bread at the Tabernacle, but instead of claiming it for himself, he made his request to the priest, who gave them the holy bread with his blessing. By contrast, when Uzziah entered the Temple and violated this sacred space, his response was typical of arrogant human hearts (26:16). He assumed that, as king, he had the right to enter God’s sacred Temple. But he did not have that right, and he was judged with affliction by a skin disease and separation from daily life. The punishment was appropriate to the arrogance of his sin.\nUzziah-like sacrilege remains an ever-present temptation. Any conduct that fails to glorify God is a violation of his sacred space. All of human history consists of the story of God restoring the entire heavens and earth to be the place of his dwelling. In the new covenant through Jesus Christ, God’s sacred space is not limited to a Temple in Jerusalem or any other building; he sets apart for himself the lives of people who trust in him (1 Cor 6:19-20). In his grace, God has made the people of the new covenant to be his temple on earth (1 Pet 2:4-5), to be the space where his holiness enters creation. History will be complete when all of heaven and earth becomes the temple of God (Isa 65:17-18; Rev 21:1-2).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 2:15-17; 3:1-6; Exod 19:12-13; 31:14-15; Lev 10:1-20; 24:16-17; Num 1:51; 15:32-36; 2 Chr 26:16-21; 1 Cor 6:19-20",

    "content": "Apostasy and Renewal\nDuring the divided monarchy, a distinction was often made between the apostate northern kingdom and the faithful remnant of Judah. When Jeroboam founded the northern kingdom, a number of righteous people went to Judah to escape Jeroboam’s wickedness (2 Chr 11:13-17). But eventually, the southern kingdom also fell into apostasy. Ahaz became like Jeroboam: He made metal images (28:2), worshiped the gods of Damascus (28:23), neglected the Temple (28:24; 29:7, 19), and spread false worship (28:24-25). His apostasy was so great that more righteousness was found in the north at that time than in Judah (see 28:9-15).\nThe Chronicler wrote to inspire hope that God would restore Judah. He showed that God is always willing to forgive those who repent. Repentance can make restoration and reconciliation possible, as shown by the northern leaders’ response to the prophet who confronted the victorious northern army (28:8-15). The renewal of Judah under Hezekiah also provided a paradigm for restoration and unification, a time that could be compared with Solomon’s reign. In the first year of his reign, Hezekiah began to restore the Temple (29:3); and when Hezekiah celebrated the Passover, he invited people from the northern kingdom, showing that both kingdoms could worship together at the place God had chosen (30:18-20). The glory of Solomon’s time was temporarily restored (30:26; cp. 7:8-10).\nEven exile did not bring an end to the covenant community. Healing was possible at any time the people chose to seek the Lord, whether at the occasion of returning with spoils of war, or reuniting at the Passover festival. Many of the Old Testament prophets who proclaimed judgment on apostate Judah or Israel also spoke of future renewal and restoration. The continual hope of renewal also holds true for the church, even when threatened with extinction from persecution or corruption (see Rev 2–3). God’s Kingdom stands on the solid rock of his promises (see Matt 16:18).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 21:1-29; 2 Chr 11:13-17; 28:1–31:21; 33:1-20; Jer 18:7-17; Ezek 16:1-63; 33:10-16; Joel 2:12-32; Luke 19:2-10; 1 Cor 6:9-11; 1 Tim 1:15-17",

    "content": "The Spirit of the Law\nIn seeking to celebrate the Passover, Hezekiah faced a dilemma. The Passover, a celebration of Israel’s redemption from Egypt, was the first festival of Israel’s liturgical year (Exod 12:1-2). Hezekiah had worked to restore Israel’s worship of the Lord. But the time between the beginning of his renewal and the first month of the year did not allow the priests sufficient time to be prepared and to gather the people (2 Chr 30:2-3). As a result, he could not celebrate the Passover at the scheduled time.\nHezekiah proceeded with the Passover, holding it a month late (30:15). He deemed having the celebration to be more important than holding it at the prescribed time. By deferring the date with the express purpose of allowing time for the people to gather at the Temple in Jerusalem, Hezekiah achieved harmony between Judah and the people from the northern kingdom and unified the celebration.\nThe precise regulations were less important than ensuring that the Passover was observed and that all could participate. Also, when the festival began, many of the people were not properly purified, so they were unable to slaughter their own sacrifices as the law required. Again, Hezekiah determined that it was more important for people to participate in the Passover than to meet the precise regulations. Hezekiah prayed for the pilgrims who had no opportunity to be properly prepared; they were not allowed to make the sacrifice in a state of impurity, but they were allowed to participate in the Passover. The right heart attitude and seeking the Lord in prayer brought God’s gracious acceptance (30:18-20; cp. 1 Cor 11:27-34).\nJesus was often criticized by the religious leaders of his day for failing to observe certain aspects of the law, especially regarding Sabbath observance and purity. Jesus’ teaching and actions conveyed that it was more important to demonstrate love toward others than to follow every minute detail of the law. He also spoke harshly of the religious leaders’ own tendency to prioritize the particularities of law observance over the principles that undergird the law. While strict law observance was foundational to Jewish identity, the spirit of the law allowed for a measure of adaptability in certain circumstances.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 12:1-30; 2 Kgs 5:17-19; 2 Chr 30:1-27; Matt 15:21-28; John 8:1-11; Rom 3:23-28; 1 Cor 11:27-34; Heb 9:13-15; Jas 5:16",

    "content": "Purity and Identity\nGod is holy, and he made a covenant with Israel to establish a holy nation (Exod 19:4-6; Lev 19:2). Israel’s identity as God’s people required purity in worship and in social relationships. God knew that if his people mingled with their pagan neighbors, they would be drawn into their detestable worship practices (see Num 25:1-9). Their failure to maintain purity and their assimilation to the surrounding cultures ultimately led to their destruction and exile (2 Kgs 17:5-23).\nWhen Ezra wrote to the Jews who had returned to Jerusalem, one of his main purposes was to remind them of their need to remain pure in their beliefs and commitments. After arriving in Jerusalem, Ezra found that the people had intermarried with pagan foreigners, even though doing so was not permitted in God’s law (see Deut 7:3-4; Josh 23:12-13). As a result, their identity as God’s holy nation was in danger of disintegrating once again (Ezra 9:1-2).\nTo impress on his readers the need for separation from these foreigners, Ezra recounts how those who first returned to Jerusalem refused to cooperate with the pagan people living around them (4:1-5). These people claimed to worship the same God, but they actually worshiped several gods in addition to Israel’s God. If the Jews had joined with these people, they soon would have compromised their beliefs and become ungodly, just as Israel had done before the Exile (see Exod 34:15-16; 1 Kgs 11:1-5; 2 Kgs 16:3). Those early leaders of the Jews in Judea understood the danger of accommodating these foreigners. They learned from their ancestors’ experience and refused to compromise the purity of their faith for the sake of peace. They carefully followed God’s instructions in everything they did (Ezra 3:2, 9; 6:18). If they were going to identify themselves as “the servants of the God of heaven and earth” (5:11), they would need to please and serve him and no other gods.\nBelievers today are identified as God’s holy people (1 Pet 2:9), a title that speaks of purity. Paul admonished the Corinthians to refrain from marrying unbelievers—for Christ and Satan have no fellowship (2 Cor 6:14-15). Righteousness and unrighteousness do not mix. The people of God must dissociate themselves from all behavior that defiles, instead clothing themselves with attitudes and actions that befit their holy status (Col 3:5-15).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 27:46–28:5; Exod 19:4-6; 34:15-16; Lev 19:2; Deut 7:3-4; Josh 23:12-13; 1 Kgs 11:1-5; Ezra 4:1-5; 5:11; 9:1–10:11; Mal 2:15; 1 Cor 6:15-20; 2 Cor 6:14-18; 2 Tim 2:21-22; 1 Pet 2:9-10",

    "content": "Completion of the Second Temple\nThe dedication of Israel’s second Temple on March 12, 515 BC, was the most significant event in the lives of those who returned from Babylonian exile. Now they could worship and praise God in the same way their ancestors had worshiped before the Exile, and God’s requirements for covenant relationship with him could be fulfilled. The high priest could go into God’s presence to sprinkle the blood once a year on the Day of Atonement for the nation’s sins. After seventy years of estrangement from God, the covenant community was now restored.\nThis joyous event did not come without difficulty. With God’s help, the returned exiles overcame sixteen years of opposition from the people who had inhabited their land and from Persian officials. Although their enemies made every attempt to discourage them, the Israelites completed the job of rebuilding the Temple and reestablishing worship through patience, persistence, and strong prophetic encouragement (Ezra 5:1-5; 6:14).\nThe dedication of the Temple demonstrates that God can accomplish his will through a small group of people who set their priorities on pleasing him and who trust him to provide the resources to fulfill his promises (see Hag 2:6-9). Instead of focusing on what little they had, the people of God trusted in what he could provide. They were dedicated to glorifying God and maintaining their relationship with him. God proved that he was sovereignly in control of nations and could change the hearts of the leaders of those nations to accomplish his will (Ezra 5:5; 6:6-12, 22).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 40:1-38; 1 Kgs 7:51–9:9; Ezra 6:14-22; Hag 1:8; 2:7-8; Zech 4:1-10; Rev 21:1-27",

    "content": "Intermarriage and Divorce\nGod had warned his people not to intermarry with unbelieving foreigners (Deut 7:1-6). The sin was not that they married people from another country or race but that they married people committed to other gods. Moses had married a Cushite woman (Num 12:1), and other foreigners had joined Israel through marriage, notably Rahab the Canaanite (see Matt 1:5) and Ruth the Moabite (Ruth 4:1-22). These women embraced faith in the Lord, and they were blessed. On the other hand, Solomon had taken many foreign wives, and their devotion to other gods led him into idolatry, just as the Lord had warned (1 Kgs 11:1-5).\nThe marriage covenant is sacred, but it was even more important for Israel to remain faithful to the Lord’s covenant with them as a people. Mixed marriages would produce children who were not fully committed to Israel’s faith, having been influenced by their foreign parent’s idolatrous beliefs. This compromise would lead Israel back to where they were before the Exile—to wholesale unfaithfulness to God and a wholehearted embrace of false religions (see Judg 3:3-7; 14:1-9; 1 Kgs 11:1-8; 2 Kgs 17:7-17).\nIn Ezra 9 and 10, the Jews who had returned from exile had married people who served other gods. Ezra’s solution (divorce) is not prescriptive for believers today. In the new covenant under Christ, the faith of a believer sanctifies his or her marriage and children, so marriage to an unbeliever does not threaten the identity or purity of the community of God’s people (1 Cor 7:14-16). The apostle Paul realized that divorce might occur when believers and unbelievers married, but he did not encourage believers in that situation to seek a divorce (1 Cor 7:10-13). Certainly, the wise policy to avoid these problems is to heed Paul’s advice not to marry an unbeliever in the first place. God’s people need to remain separated from what is unholy: “How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil? How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever?” (2 Cor 6:14-15). But those who are married to an unbeliever today have God’s assurance that he can use that difficult situation for his glory (see also 1 Pet 3:1-2).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 7:1-6; Josh 2:1-14; 6:23-25; Judg 3:3-7; 14:1-9; Ruth 4:1-22; 1 Kgs 11:1-8; 2 Kgs 17:7-17; Ezra 9:1–10:44; 1 Cor 7:10-16; 2 Cor 6:14-15; Heb 11:31",

    "content": "God Works through Prayer\nAlthough God is sovereign over all creation, he desires for his people to bring their concerns to him in prayer. Throughout the Bible, we see examples of God acting in response to the prayers of his people. Prayer is essential for anyone who desires to live a godly life and carry out an effective ministry, as it is the means by which God’s people align their will with his.\nThe brief account relayed in the book of Nehemiah exhibits a man whose life was steeped in prayer. In response to Jerusalem’s disgraceful condition, Nehemiah spent four months in intensive intercessory prayer (cp. Neh 1:1; 2:1). His prayers included praising God for his power and covenant love, confessing the nation’s sins, and calling on God to act (1:4-11; cp. Ezra 9:6-15; Dan 9:4-19). Nehemiah based his prayer for Jerusalem on God’s “covenant of unfailing love with those who love him and obey his commands” (1:5). The Israelites had not obeyed the instructions God gave to Moses (1:7), resulting in the exile of the nation as God had warned. However, Nehemiah was firmly convinced that God would keep his promise to restore the nation if the people repented (1:8-9; see Deut 4:25-31; 30:1-5).\nWhen God presented an opening for Nehemiah to approach the Persian king about returning to Jerusalem, Nehemiah immediately prayed for God’s guidance (Neh 2:4). He knew that only God could change the king’s heart. Later, Nehemiah made a practical and balanced response to threats against those building the wall by posting guards and rallying the people, all while praying for God’s protection and strength (4:4-5, 9; 6:9, 14). He needed God’s help and blessing then and in the future as he confronted people who acted improperly.\nWhen Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem after a brief visit to Persia, he found that some Jews were not contributing their tithe (13:10-12), some were not keeping the Sabbath (13:15-16), and some had married unbelievers (13:23-24). When confronting these people about their sin, Nehemiah prayed for God to have compassion on him and remember what he had done (13:14, 22, 31). Nehemiah knew that he had to depend on God’s power to transform people.\nEven Jesus, who already had a keen awareness of the Father’s will, bathed his ministry in prayer (see, e.g., Luke 5:16; 6:12-16; 9:18). Following his example, the early Christians spent much time in prayer, operating with a firm belief in its effectiveness (see, e.g., 9:36-41; 12:3-11). God often responds powerfully to his people’s prayers, and believers are encouraged to pray with eager expectation (see Jas 5:16-18).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 24:10-20; Judg 15:18-20; Ezra 9:6-15; Neh 1:4-11; 2:4-5; 4:4-5, 9; Pss 18:1-30; 22:4-5, 24; 30:2-3; 31:22; 34:4; 40:1-2; 81:7; 106:1-48; 107:6-7, 13-14; 116:1; 118:5; Dan 9:4-19; Jon 2:1-10; Acts 4:24-31; Jas 5:16-18",

    "content": "Rebuilding of Jerusalem\nThe wall of Jerusalem had great political, social, and religious significance for the people of Judah (see Neh 2:10, 19; 4:1-15; 6:1-14). In the ancient world and up to the modern era, a city without walls would not remain a city for long. Walls protected a city both from invading nations and from common criminals. By Nehemiah’s time, the walls of Jerusalem had lain in ruins for over a hundred years, since the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The destroyed wall was a shameful reminder that God had brought punishment on the city, fulfilling the covenant curses because of the people’s sin (1:2-7; 2:17). Consequently, the rebuilt wall would be a sign of God’s blessing and proof that God was bringing the promised restoration to his covenant people. Israel’s enemies knew that if the wall was rebuilt, the Jews would gain political power, security, and self-determination; so they fiercely opposed the rebuilding.\nUnder Nehemiah’s leadership, the inhabitants of Judea rebuilt the entire wall in only fifty-two days during the fall of 445 BC. The speed and success of the reconstruction is a witness to all believers that with God’s help, his people can accomplish amazing things (see 2:18; 4:14-15, 20; 6:16).\nPassages for Further Study\nNeh 1:2-4; 2:10-20; 3:1-32; 4:1-23; 6:1-16; Ps 51:16-18; Isa 22:5; 26:1-3; Rev 21:10-27",

    "content": "Dealing with Conflict\nGod’s people often have to deal with conflict, either from those outside the community who are opposed to God and his purposes or from those inside the community who cause strife and division. Dealing with conflict requires a great deal of wisdom and tact, as even the smallest conflicts can turn disastrous. Paul faced opposition from government (Acts 16:22-24) and community leaders (Acts 19:23-34). Moses dealt with the grumbling and dissatisfied people of Israel (e.g., Exod 17:1-4). The book of Nehemiah provides perhaps the most comprehensive example of how a godly person can respond to conflict.\nNehemiah faced both external and internal opposition to all that God was directing him to do. External opposition came from foreigners such as Sanballat, Geshem, and Tobiah. They fiercely opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls and mocked Nehemiah’s leadership (Neh 2:10, 2:19; 4:1-3). The opposition gradually grew to include other Arabs, Ammonites, and people from Ashdod, who plotted to attack the builders (4:7-9, 11). To meet this opposition, Nehemiah posted guards, prayed for God’s help, developed an emergency warning system, and kept working (4:6-23). Israel’s frustrated enemies made several attempts to disgrace or kill Nehemiah (6:1-14). However, Nehemiah had the wisdom to avoid or frustrate their plots while focusing on the task God had given him.\nNehemiah also faced internal problems. Wealthy Jews were mistreating the poor by charging high interest (5:1-13). Jews had married foreigners who worshiped other gods (13:23-30). Many were not tithing or keeping the Sabbath holy (10:31-39; 13:10-22). Finally, he had to oppose the priest Eliashib, who had allowed Tobiah to use one of the Temple storerooms (13:4-9). Confronting these problems required a firm commitment to the principles explained in Scripture, boldness in insisting that people follow these divine instructions, and compassion in restoring people to fellowship after the confrontation.\nIn each of these cases, Nehemiah courageously followed the example of earlier leaders such as Moses, who opposed the worship of the gold calf (Exod 32); Samuel, who opposed those involved with Baal worship (1 Sam 7:3-8); Nathan, who opposed David’s sins (2 Sam 12:1-14); and Jehoshaphat, who trusted in God to defeat a much stronger enemy (2 Chr 20:1-37). Like these earlier men of God, Nehemiah took a stand for what was right instead of letting those for whom he was responsible go their own ways. He refused to be discouraged or intimidated by internal difficulties or external threats against him. He consistently depended on God for wisdom and for blessing on his work.\nJesus and Paul both outlined some strategies for dealing with internal conflict (Matt 5:23-26; 18:15-17; 1 Cor 6:1-8; 10:23-33) and external conflict (Matt 5:43-47; Rom 12:14-21). Unfortunately, the actions of believers, no matter how upstanding, will sometimes be met with continued—or even increased—opposition. Nonetheless, we are called to handle opposition in a way similar to Nehemiah—with wisdom, patience, prayer, and resolve.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 13:5-13; 26:12-35; Exod 32:1-35; 1 Sam 7:3-8; 2 Sam 12:1-31; 19:41-43; 2 Chr 20:1-37; 34:3-7; Neh 2:19-20; 4:1-23; 5:1-13; 6:1-14; 13:4-28; Ps 140:1-2; Prov 13:10; 17:14, 19; 25:8; 26:17, 21; 29:22; Hab 1:3; Acts 23:6-11; 2 Cor 7:5-6; Eph 6:10-18; Phil 2:3; 1 Tim 6:4; 2 Tim 2:14, 23-26; Titus 2:15; Jas 3:13-18",

    "content": "The Centrality of God’s Word\nWhen God gave the Law to his people at Sinai, it was written in stone (Exod 34:1) and was to be taught to children (Deut 6:7), worn on the hands and forehead, and written on doorposts (Deut 6:8-9), so that people would constantly be reminded of what God had said. God’s instructions were also to be read to the people every seven years so that they would remember to fear God (Deut 31:9-13). Success depended on meditating on God’s word and following it (Josh 1:7-8; Pss 1:2; 119:15). Obedience was far more important than offering sacrifices (1 Sam 15:22).\nBut when God’s people neglect his Word and take their eyes off his truth, we have a tendency to fall away from the life he envisions for us. In the time of Josiah, even the priests had lost and forgotten the Book of the Law. When it was discovered in the Temple (2 Kgs 22:8-13), the young king read it and tore his clothing, realizing how the nation had forsaken the covenant.\nIn the fall of 445 BC, Nehemiah finished rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem. Just five days later, on the first day of the seventh month, the settlers in Judah came together to celebrate the Festival of Trumpets. During and after the festival, Ezra read from the Law, and as the people listened they mourned and wept, for they realized they had not obeyed God’s law. They confessed their sins, studied God’s word to learn what he required, and obeyed what they learned. The Book of the Law of Moses thus transformed their lives and behavior.\nThese events provide a dramatic reminder that God’s word is central to the lives of his people. God’s word provides the essential guide to life or death (Gen 2:16-17), and his promises prove true (e.g., Gen 17:15-21; 18:10-14).\nGod’s word is perfect. It has the power to restore, make wise, and give joy (Ps 19:7-9). Godly individuals love God’s word (Ps 119:97). It sheds light on their paths (Ps 119:105) and keeps them from sin (Ps 119:9). God’s word accomplishes its purpose (Isa 55:11) and remains perpetually relevant (Matt 5:17-19; 24:35; 2 Tim 3:14-17).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 24:7; 34:1; Deut 4:2; 6:4-9; 31:9-13; Josh 1:7-8; 1 Sam 15:22; Neh 8:1–10:39; 13:1-3; Pss 1:2-3; 19:7-9; 119:9, 15, 97, 105; Isa 55:10-11; Matt 5:17-19; 13:3-23; 24:35; 2 Tim 3:14-17",

    "content": "Nehemiah’s Confidence in God\nGod gave Nehemiah favor in the eyes of a mighty Persian king so that the king responded favorably to all of Nehemiah’s requests (Neh 1:11; 2:8, 18). Nehemiah then had the confidence to present his bold plan to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, and the people of Jerusalem responded positively, believing that God was able to give them success (2:18) and to protect them from their enemies (4:4-5, 9). They confidently continued with their work in spite of opposition because they knew that God fights for his people and frustrates the plans of the wicked (4:14-15, 20). When the walls of Jerusalem were finished, Nehemiah recognized that the entire difficult project was completed only because of God’s help (6:16).\nThe book of Nehemiah vividly demonstrates that God is all-powerful and able to accomplish his will, both in individual lives and in nations. The prayer in Nehemiah 9 focuses on praising God for his sovereign and powerful acts: God created the heavens and earth (9:6), called Abram from Ur, and gave the land to Israel (9:7-8, 22-25). The miraculous signs in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of guidance, food, and water in the wilderness all demonstrate God’s power over man and nature to provide for his people (9:9-15).\nThe Lord had sent the Israelites into exile after generations of persistent sin (9:32-37). Now he was fulfilling part of his promise to restore them (1:8-9). Nehemiah had the confidence to pray and lead because he knew that everything that happened was part of God’s sovereign plan. This same confidence in God led Abram to leave Ur and by faith go to an unknown land (Gen 12:1-3; Heb 11:8-10), caused Rahab to trust in God (Josh 2:9-14; Heb 11:31), and prompted Hezekiah not to give in to the demands of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (2 Kgs 18:1–19:37). Confidence comes when people believe that God will keep his promises and complete the work he has started in their lives (Phil 1:6).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:1-4; Josh 1:10-18; 2:9-14; 2 Kgs 18:1–19:37; Neh 1:8-9, 11; 2:8, 18, 20; 4:4-5, 9, 14-15, 20; 6:16; 9:6-31; Pss 4:5; 9:10; 37:3; 40:3; 44:6-7; 56:3-12; 112:1-9; Prov 3:5-12; 16:20; 28:1, 25; Isa 26:3; Heb 11:8-10, 31; 1 Jn 4:17",

    "content": "Ethnic Hatred\nSelfish pride, a desire to maintain power, and hatred for those who stand in the way have often been the basis for the persecution of racial or religious groups. Many people have died through the centuries because of such hatred.\nIn the book of Esther, Haman hated Mordecai because Mordecai would not bow down as everyone else did when Haman passed by (Esth 3:1-5). Haman thus despised a man of integrity who would not obey laws that were against his convictions. This personal hatred of Mordecai the Jew developed into a murderous desire to destroy all Jews (3:6). His charge against the Jewish people was what he hated in Mordecai: They did not assimilate with other people, they had unique laws and customs, and they did not obey some of the laws of the king (3:8).\nThe Spanish Inquisition (1400s) and the Holocaust in Nazi Germany (1930s–40s) were other terrible attempts to wipe the Jewish people off the face of the earth. Religious and ethnic hatred still leads to diabolical plans today.\nGod disapproves of such hatred against any ethnic or religious group, and he will eventually hold accountable those who attempt to carry out such plots (see Deut 30:7; Pss 21:7-11; 34:19-21; 44:7). God has repeatedly saved the Jewish people and defeated their enemies, for God is faithful to all his promises (see Rom 9–11). He will similarly preserve his church through all persecution (see Matt 16:18; Rom 8:26-39).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 46:33-34; Deut 7:1-6; 23:3-8; Esth 3:1-9; Matt 15:22-28; Luke 4:27; Acts 10:34-35; Rom 9:1–11:36; Gal 3:26-29; Eph 2:14",

    "content": "Purim\nThe Festival of Purim is the only Old Testament festival not established during the time of Moses. Its name is derived from a word that means lots or dice (Hebrew purim, derived from Akkadian puru). It was a common practice in the ancient world to cast purim to determine whether God favored a particular course of action: A good number would indicate God’s approval, a bad number his disapproval. Near the king’s throne room at Susa in Persia, archaeologists found a small four-sided object with a number engraved on each side. A similar die inscribed with the word pur dates to the 800s BC. In the book of Esther, the Persian astrologers used purim to establish the best time to slaughter the Jews (Esth 3:7).\nOn the fateful day—March 7, 473 BC—God miraculously rescued his people from certain death, just as he had rescued the nation from Egypt at the Passover. Mordecai and Esther therefore formalized an annual celebration of God’s rescue so that all future generations would remember what God had accomplished (9:28). The festival was widely celebrated thereafter among Jews (see 2 Maccabees 15:36; Josephus, Antiquities 11.6.13; perhaps John 5:1).\nWhen God rescued his chosen people, the day for Jewish execution turned into a day of holy vengeance and was followed by a day of celebration. Today, Jewish people fast and pray to commemorate Esther’s fasting. This fast is then followed by Purim, which is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar (occurring in February or March). On this joyous holiday Jews read Esther (with loud boos for Haman and hoorays for Mordecai) and have a time of feasting and rejoicing, with gifts for friends and for the poor. It is a celebration of how God providentially worked to care for his people so that they were not exterminated (9:1-17) and of how God continues to care for, provide for, and save his people (see also Gen 45:5; Ps 91; Prov 16:9, 33; Dan 2:21; Acts 1:6-7; 2:22-23; 4:28-30; 17:24-27; Rom 8:28; 1 Pet 3:12).\nPassages for Further Study\nEsth 9:1-32; Pss 37:23; 91:1-16; Prov 16:9, 33; Rom 8:28; 1 Pet 3:12",

    "content": "Complaints\nThe Bible generally depicts complaining as wrong. For example, God judged the Israelites for grumbling about their hardships in the wilderness (Num 14:27-37). Job complained mightily and earned God’s rebuke for it, yet God ultimately confirmed Job’s righteousness and rejected those who tried to stop him from complaining (Job 42:7-8).\nJob’s fundamental complaint was that God did not give him a fair hearing to demonstrate his innocence. Job’s friends attacked him for trying to vindicate himself, but God upheld Job’s innocence. In a gracious but firm act of self-revelation, God rebuked Job for his overreaching self-defense and implied criticism of God’s fairness. God shifted Job’s focus away from his troubles and toward God himself (Job 38–41).\nScripture admonishes us to rejoice and give thanks in all situations (Eph 5:20; Phil 4:4; 1 Thes 5:16-18). It also calls us to endure through suffering and to persist in prayer (Jas 5:10-18). If we do want to complain in prayer, we should follow the pattern of the psalms, which lead us past ourselves and back to God (see, e.g., Ps 13). Job’s positive example (Jas 5:11) is not so much in how he responded to his troubles or to his comforters but in how he responded to God (Job 40:3-5; 42:1-6). In the midst of difficult and confusing situations that may precipitate a desire to complain, we can still acknowledge the sovereignty and goodness of God.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 4:13-14; Exod 16:2-18; Num 14:27-37; 1 Kgs 19:3-18; Job 3:1-26; 6:1–7:21; Pss 38; 39; 44; 73; Jer 20:14-18; Jon 4:1-11; Matt 27:46; John 6:41-59; 1 Cor 10:1-10; Eph 5:20; Phil 2:14-15; Jas 5:9-11",

    "content": "Material Reward\nIt was a common Old Testament belief that righteous people would always prosper materially. They interpreted contemporary wisdom (as in the book of Proverbs) as a universal rule. Some hold this view today. One problem with this theology is that it can induce false guilt and accusations when prosperity does not come (and spiritual complacency when it does come).\nJob’s suffering provides an example. His friends accepted this traditional theological view. They said that Job’s troubles stood as evidence against him (19:5). They claimed that his suffering was punishment for his sin (4:7-9) and believed that Job’s penalty was probably less than he deserved (11:6). However, God’s analysis of Job’s life proved this idea to be false (42:7-8). God testified to his special relationship with Job and restored Job’s good reputation as his servant.\nMaterial well-being is not necessarily in opposition to spiritual blessing. Once we equate blessings with material gain, however, “the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and the desire for other things” tend to crowd out our attention to spiritual blessings (Mark 4:19; see also Luke 6:25). We can easily shift to greed, covetousness, and lust. And our self-esteem can come to be based on what we own (even if we still owe many payments on it). This worldview is not Christian but characterizes worldly people (1 Jn 2:15-17).\nIn his suffering, Job moved from complaint to renewed humility as he acknowledged God’s righteous power (Job 40:4-5; 42:2-6). We, too, can regard hardships as occasions for spiritual growth (Jas 1:2-4).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 13:2; 1 Kgs 10:23; Job 4:7-9; 11:6; 19:5; Pss 49:16-20; 73:1-28; Prov 14:20; 18:11; 28:11; Eccl 5:10-20; Jer 17:11; Zeph 1:18; Matt 27:57; Mark 4:19; 10:17-25; Luke 6:24-25; 16:10-31; 1 Tim 6:17; Jas 1:2-4, 9; 5:1; 1 Jn 2:16; 3 Jn 1:2",

    "content": "The Righteous Suffer\nThe book of Job invites us to examine the basis of our faith in God. Job’s loss of possessions and family members and the alienation of his friends shook his faith to its foundation. However, he maintained his trust in God, and he proved Satan’s accusations to be lies.\nSin undoubtedly brings suffering, but as the book of Job demonstrates, suffering is not necessarily the result of one’s sin. Human suffering is more complex than a simple equation of individual behavior and consequence. Some today blindly follow Job’s friends in equating godliness with material blessing. But at its root, this perspective is flawed, as demonstrated by the many examples throughout history of righteous suffering—including, of course, Christ himself. As believers we are told that “we must also share [Christ’s] suffering” and “what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us later” (Rom 8:17-18). At the core of being a disciple of Christ is a willingness to follow him into suffering (see Luke 9:23-25; Phil 3:10-11).\nEven in his complaints, Job acknowledged that only God could provide the answers he needed. When Job wished for death, it was to gain relief until God could deal with him under more favorable conditions (14:13). When Job desired a mediator (9:33-35), it was to facilitate finding favor with God. When Job complained that God didn’t listen, it was because he knew that his answers had to come from God (see 19:25-27). That is the very essence of faith.\nWe are not meant to know or understand everything (see Gen 2:16-17; Deut 29:29; Acts 1:7; 1 Thes 5:1-2). Some things are for God alone to comprehend and direct according to his sovereign will. Our response is to live by faith. Even when we suffer, we can trust God (see Rom 8:26-39).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 4:4-8; 26:17-33; 31:38-42; 37:2-36; 39:1-20; Exod 1:8-11; 1 Sam 18:10-11, 28-29; 19:10; 22:1-19; 1 Kgs 21:1-15; 2 Chr 24:20-22; Job 9:33-35; 14:13; 19:25-27; Isa 54:17; Jer 11:18-21; 26:1-23; 38:1-13; Matt 23:29-37; John 5:24; 15:20; Acts 6:8–7:60; Rom 8:17-18, 26-39; Heb 12:1-13; 1 Pet 4:12-16",

    "content": "Counsel from Others\nThe book of Proverbs teaches that many counselors are good because they provide safety (Prov 11:14; 24:6) and improve our odds of success (Prov 15:22). The book of Job shows that counselors can also mislead, even when their theology is evidently orthodox (Job 12:17; 26:3).\nJob’s friends initially joined with Job in his suffering, sitting silently in grief with him for seven days (Job 2:11-13). But as soon as they opened their mouths, their consolation ended. Job’s comforters repeatedly elaborated on the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, which was deeply embedded in the covenant (Lev 26; Deut 28; Prov 1:31; 22:8; Hos 8:7; see also Gal 6:7-8). We can’t simply reject their words because much of what they said is correct teaching about God’s nature and his ways of working with human beings. However, Job’s friends misapplied this principle (see Job 4:8). They didn’t look at Job’s life, point out where he had sown evil, and then threaten divine judgment. Instead, they ignored Job’s faithful pattern of life, focused on his torment, and concluded that he was reaping the effects of sin. God eventually called these counselors liars, reminding us that right theology must be rightly applied in order to please God and build up others (Prov 15:2-4, 23; 25:11; Isa 50:4; Eph 4:29).\nWhile it is good to weigh advice from various sources, we must compare the counsel of others with what we believe to be right before God (see, e.g., Acts 20:22; 21:4, 11, 13). God might use human counselors to help us define his will, but God himself also guides us through his Spirit (John 16:13-15). Jesus Christ is our “Wonderful Counselor” (Isa 9:6; see Isa 28:29), who embodies “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col 2:3). And when we have opportunities to come alongside others in moments of grief, we must be cautious and tactful in how we apply scriptural principles. Often, our silent presence is the most helpful counsel we can offer.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 17:1-23; 1 Kgs 12:3-17; 22:15-28; Job 2:9-10; 4:8; 12:17; 16:2; Prov 1:5; 9:9; 11:14; 12:15; 15:2-4, 22-23; 19:20; 20:18; 24:6; 25:11; 27:9; Isa 9:6; 28:29; 50:4; Rom 8:14; Eph 4:29; Col 2:3",

Sometimes they are swallowed alive (Num 16:31-33; Ps 55:15), but generally they are dragged down by the cords of death (Ps 18:4-5) to be consumed (Num 16:30; Job 24:19; Pss 49:14; Isa 5:14; 14:11). In the Old Testament, the afterlife is generally regarded as a gloomy, hopeless place of no return (Job 7:9; Isa 38:18).\nIn Job, the key images of the realm of the dead are dark and dusty Sheol (Job 11:8; 14:13; 17:13, 16; 24:19; 26:6), a pit fouled with the filth of decomposition (Hebrew shakhat; see 9:31; 17:14; 33:18, 22, 24, 28, 30), and the grave (Hebrew qeber; see 3:22; 5:26; 10:19; 17:1; 21:32).\nThe Old Testament does give occasional hints of deliverance from the grave (see 1 Sam 2:6; Pss 16:10-11; 30:3; 49:15; 56:13; 73:24-26; 86:13; 139:7-10; Isa 26:19). Job hopes that Sheol might relieve him of his troubles (Job 3:13-22; 14:13-17) and that a redeemer might justify him even after death (19:25-26). But only the New Testament gives the full promise of redemption from death (1 Cor 15:50-58).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 2:6; 28:11-15; 1 Kgs 17:20-22; 2 Kgs 4:32-35; Job 3:13-22; 7:9; 14:13-17; 17:13-16; 19:25-27; Pss 6:5; 16:10-11; 17:15; 49:15; 86:13; 88:11; 139:8; 141:7; Prov 1:12; 15:11; Isa 26:19; 38:18; Ezek 26:20; Matt 22:31-32; Rom 8:23; 1 Cor 15:50-58; Phil 3:21",

    "content": "Job’s Innocence\nJob’s comforters could not stomach the idea that any human could be truly innocent (Job 4:17-19; 15:14-16; 25:4-6). Job’s claim to innocence also seems to conflict with the biblical teaching that “no one is righteous—not even one. . . . All fall short of God’s glorious standard” (Rom 3:10, 23). Was Job right in proclaiming his innocence?\nEliphaz and the others talked right past Job. When they denied that Job could be right or pure, they were referring to the absolute difference between the creature and the Creator. But Job was not claiming absolute purity. He acknowledged his youthful sins (Job 13:26) and was aware of his need to have his sins and his guilt covered (14:16-17).\nNonetheless, Job repeatedly claimed to be a man of integrity and innocence in his relationship with God (13:14-18; 23:10-12; 27:3-6; 31:1-40). Even Eliphaz acknowledged that Job’s life was upright (4:6). Job’s faith made him doggedly pursue an audience with God and tenaciously believe in God’s justice despite his immediate experience. Job kept looking for his Redeemer (19:25). Although God’s justice might require a mediator (9:33-35), and it might not be evident before death (19:26), it guaranteed Job’s acquittal. Job lived “by believing and not by seeing” (2 Cor 5:7; see also Rom 8:24; 1 Cor 13:12; 2 Cor 4:18; Heb 11:1-2; 1 Pet 1:6-8).\nWhen held up to the light of Christ’s absolute righteousness, Job stands with all of us as a sinner. Job was not justified by his deeds but by his faith, and on that basis God declared that Job was “blameless—a man of complete integrity” (Job 1:1, 8; 2:3; 42:7-8). God does the same for us when we, like Job, put our complete trust in him (see Rom 4:4-5; Jas 2:23).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 8:46; Job 1:1, 8-11; 2:3-5; 4:6; 9:33-34; 13:18; 14:16-17; 15:14; 19:25-26; 23:10; 25:4; 27:5-6; 42:7-8; Pss 25:7; 37:37; 51:17; Ezek 4:14; Rom 3:10, 23, 25; 4:4-5; 6:23; 1 Cor 13:12; 2 Cor 4:18",

    "content": "Understanding Job\nFor as long as people have read Job’s story, they have struggled with the tension between the positive and negative aspects of Job’s character. The book’s approval of Job in the opening prologue is unequivocal (1:1, 8; 2:3), yet we later hear God interrogate Job: “Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorant words?” (38:2). “Will you discredit my justice and condemn me just to prove you are right?” (40:8).\nGod’s questions have led various interpreters to accuse Job of talking too much and even of confusing God’s work with the work of Satan. Some contemporary interpretations side with Job’s counselors in blaming Job for his suffering. Still others follow Eliphaz (5:17-27) and Elihu (33:15-33; 36:7-17) in arguing that Job’s suffering was God’s loving and sanctifying chastisement. Even the faithful are not exempt from such discipline (Heb 12:6-12; see Prov 3:11-12), but this explanation flies in the face of the rationale given in the book’s opening verses.\nJob suffered because God wanted to prove Job’s integrity to Satan. God’s own judgment of Job’s life was positive from start to finish (Job 1:1, 8; 2:3; 42:7). This perspective carries through to the New Testament, where Job is an example of endurance that we should imitate (Jas 5:11).\nJob’s reactions are normal. He does not stand like a rock in reverent stoicism as though he were unaffected by his trials. Neither does he trumpet heroic defiance of his troubles, as though they could never get him down. He reacts in a natural human way. Job rages, protests, moans, and vacillates between confidence and despair, but he never gives up. He does not curse God, and he does not make a false confession of guilt in the hope that God will then let up on him. Although Job cannot understand his situation, he knows that his answer will be found in God (Job 19:25-27).\nPassages for Further Study\nJob 1:1, 8; 2:3; 5:17-18; 19:25-27; 33:15-28; 36:8-15; 38:2; 40:8; 42:7; Prov 3:11; Heb 12:7, 10; Jas 5:11",

    "content": "Royal Psalms\nThe royal psalms all have some reference to the king, the nature of his rule, and his relationship to God. Psalms 2, 18, 20, 21, 45, 61, 72, 89, 101, 110, 132, and 144 are usually regarded as the royal psalms.\nBelief in God’s kingship is the foundation of the royal psalms (see Ps 2). Each king in David’s dynasty served as messianic agent—i.e., he represented God’s kingship. As God’s representative, the Davidic king was expected to uphold the qualities of justice, righteousness, faithfulness, and peace (72:1-3).\nThe royal psalms express the hope and aspirations of the dynasty of David. But with its corruption and failure, the dynasty came to an apparent end (89:38-45). Yet hope remained alive for the future of a king descended from David who would serve as God’s agent. The royal psalms maintain this hope for a king whose perfect obedience would guarantee the continuity of David’s dynasty and the perpetual benefits of his reign.\nIn this sense, the royal psalms may also be called messianic psalms in that they express hope in a messianic agent, an ideal king descended from David. Jesus stated that the psalmists wrote of him (Luke 24:44), and other NT writers affirmed the identification of Jesus as the Messiah. Some of the most significant links to Christ are as follows:\nPsalm 2 is associated with Israel’s king, the descendant of David. Nevertheless, it speaks of a universal vindication and rule that far transcends even David’s or Solomon’s reigns (see Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5; 5:5).\nPsalm 45 is a marriage psalm for one of the Davidic kings, possibly Solomon, yet it speaks of a permanent rule (45:6).\nPsalm 110 is the most frequently quoted messianic psalm (see Matt 22:43-45; Acts 2:34-35; Heb 1:13; 5:5-10; 6:20; 7:21). It speaks of the privileges, universal victory, and continuing priesthood of David and his successors. Such language would be hyperbole, and possibly misleading, except for its fulfillment in Jesus. In contrast to the angels who are privileged to stand in God’s presence (see Luke 1:19), Christ the Son sits in the place of power and authority over all things at God’s right hand (Heb 1:13).\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 2; 18; 20; 21; 45; 61; 72; 89; 101; 110; 132; 144; Acts 2:34-35; 13:33; Heb 1:5, 13; 5:5-10",

    "content": "The Poor and Needy in the Psalms\nThroughout Scripture, God advocates for the poor and needy, who often experience oppression and persecution at the hands of societal structures or the rapacious people around them. The book of Psalms makes numerous references both to the plights of the oppressed and to God’s concern for those experiencing oppression. In their distress, the poor and needy can take refuge in the Lord (see Ps 76:9; 107:4-9) and cry out to him (see 25:16-18; 70:1-5; 74:19), for he has promised to care for them. They can have faith in him and wait hopefully for him to appear and bring justice (18:1-50; 70:5).\nMuch of life might be lived in anguish (88:13-15; 90:15; see 102:1-28). And affliction might be a form of discipline that gives training in righteousness (119:71, 75). Regardless of the duration, severity, and cause of the suffering, the Lord hears the cry of the poor, as many psalms testify (10:17-18; 12:5; 22:24; 35:10; 109:31; 113:5-7; 140:12). In the end, the poor will be satisfied (see 22:26; 132:15) and the godly will rejoice (see 34:1-2; 69:32).\nWhile the Davidic kings were to bring justice to God’s afflicted people (72:2, 4, 12), they ultimately failed to do so. The messianic king, Jesus, who has identified with our human situation (Isa 53:4, 7), has come bringing relief to the poor and downtrodden (Luke 4:17-21; see Isa 61:1-3). He is the hope of those who recognize their need for him and who hunger and thirst for righteousness (see Matt 5:3-12).\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 9:18; 10:1-18; 12:5; 22:1-31; 34:1-22; 35:10; 37:14; 40:17; 41:1; 49:2; 68:10; 69:33; 70:5; 72:2-4, 12-13; 74:21; 82:3-4; 107:41; 109:16, 22, 31; 132:15; 140:12",

    "content": "Salvation in the Psalms\nThe psalmists experienced God’s salvation as rescue from evil in the world. They were well acquainted with grief, and in times of affliction, it seemed to them that God had abandoned them. Meanwhile, the wicked took advantage of the apparent injustice to ridicule the godly (3:2; 71:10-11).\nThe psalmists cried out for rescue, knowing that they were completely dependent on the Lord (31:15; 35:17; 69:13). While waiting for rescue, the psalmists had faith that the Lord was with them, keeping guard over them (Pss 46, 121), and would not abandon them (16:10; 94:14; see also 7:10; 31:2; 62:6-7; 144:2).\nGod graciously rescues his needy servants and answers their prayers (20:6; 28:8; 34:6, 18; 40:1-2; 76:9; 107; 145:19; 149:4). When the Lord rescues his people, he receives glory through their thanksgiving, praise, and testimony (50:15; 79:9; 85:9). God’s mighty acts are recorded in Scripture so that his people will praise him for what he has done and trust him to rescue them.\nThe psalms encourage the godly to identify themselves with these stories of salvation. For example, in Psalm 18 the psalmist describes his anguish, his lament, and the Lord’s salvation (18:17, 19, 20, 43, 48) in such a manner that all the humble are invited to look to the Lord in hope (see 72:12). The Lord has rescued his people throughout history, and the Lord will save his people again.\nSalvation excludes the wicked (69:27; 119:155), who ridicule those who hope in the Lord’s rescue (22:8). The wicked may call to the Lord in their hour of judgment, but he will not rescue them (18:27; 50:22). Hope in God’s salvation requires a life of faith (119:123) and love of the Lord (60:5; 108:6). Such faith casts out fear (34:4), knowing that the Lord does what is right (71:2).\nThe Lord Jesus came to save sinners. He ministered to the needy and the marginalized, bringing physical deliverance to many; and he died under oppression, bringing spiritual deliverance to the world. He rescues people from themselves, from Satan, from death, and from adversity. He has the power to vindicate the faithful, judge sinners, and completely save all of God’s children. He will renew all things, while excluding the wicked from his everlasting salvation.\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 3:7-8; 6:4; 7:10; 14:7; 16:9-11; 17:7; 18:1-50; 20:6; 22:4-5; 25:4-14; 27:1; 31:1-2, 15-16; 32:1-5; 33:18-19; 34:6-7, 17-19; 40:16-17; 43:5; 46:1-11; 62:1-8; 70:4-5; 72:12-14; 80:1-19; 91:1-16; 98:1-3; 107:1-43; 121:1-8; 149:4",

    "content": "Psalms of Suffering\nThe four psalms of suffering (also called “Passion Psalms”; Pss 16; 22; 40; 69) address the deep distress experienced by God’s servant.\nPsalm 22 has perhaps the most remarkable language of the psalms of suffering. In this psalm, God’s servant suffers though he is righteous. There is no suggestion of any sin, so the psalmist’s suffering appears completely unjustified. Despite bitter persecution, there is no prayer for vengeance (see Ps 137). This psalm has some noteworthy connections with the crucifixion of Christ (e.g., Ps 22:6-8, 14-18). In fact, Jesus recited part of Psalm 22 when he was on the cross (22:1; see Matt 27:46). The sinless Christ even prayed for his executioners (Luke 23:34).\nThe other psalms of suffering also came to be associated with Christ. Psalm 16:10 anticipates Christ’s triumph over death (cp. Acts 2:24-31). Psalm 40:6-8 foreshadows the self-giving, redemptive work of Christ (Heb 10:5-10). Psalm 69 refers to isolation as resulting from commitment to God’s cause (69:8-9). It also anticipates the part Judas played in what was fundamentally God’s work in Christ (69:25-26; see Ps 109:8; Isa 53:10; Acts 1:20).\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 16; 22; 40; 69; 102; 109; Isa 42:1-9; 52:13–53:12; Matt 27:46; Luke 23:34; Heb 10:5-10",

    "content": "The Shepherd\nIn the Jewish economy, the shepherd who tended a flock of sheep or goats held a position of importance. Shepherding was fundamental to ancient Near Eastern society. The shepherd’s task was to lead the flock out of the fold each morning (John 10:2-4), to find grass and water for the flock, to protect them from wild animals (Amos 3:12), to look for and restore those that strayed (Ezek 34:8; Matt 18:12), and to return the flock to the fold every evening.\nThe word shepherd became a common term for a ruler. The kings of Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt were often referred to as shepherds who protected their people. This metaphorical use is also prevalent in the Old Testament (Num 27:17; 1 Kgs 22:17; Jer 10:21; 23:1-2; Ezek 34:1-10).\nIn the Old Testament, God is pictured as the Shepherd of Israel, concerned for every aspect of his people’s welfare (Gen 49:24; Pss 23:1; 80:1; Isa 40:11). God himself would provide for his flock (Jer 23:3; 31:10; Ezek 34:11-22), and he promised to provide faithful shepherds who showed concern for his people (Jer 3:15; 23:4). When Israel’s early leaders proved to be unfaithful shepherds, God intervened and appointed his servant David as a faithful shepherd to lead them. He later promised that he would establish David’s offspring as shepherd over them (see Ezek 34:23-24). By the time of the prophet Jeremiah, shepherd began to be used with reference to the coming Messiah.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus referred to himself as the Shepherd (Matt 25:31-33; Mark 14:27; John 10:1-30). He is the Good Shepherd who gives his life for the sheep (John 10:11-18; see also Heb 13:20).\nThe leaders of the church are also called shepherds (Eph 4:11, translated “pastors”)—God gives them to the church to care for his people as a shepherd does their sheep, leading and teaching them in the ways of God. They are to be faithful shepherds until the Chief Shepherd, Jesus Christ, appears to lead his people directly (1 Pet 5:1-4).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 29:1-10; Num 27:16-18; 2 Sam 7:7; 1 Kgs 22:17; 1 Chr 11:2; Pss 23:1-6; 77:20; 80:1; Isa 40:11; 44:28; 56:10-11; Jer 10:21; 25:34-36; Ezek 34:1-31; Mic 7:14; Zech 10:2b-3; 11:4-17; 13:7; Matt 2:6; 18:12-14; 26:31; John 10:1-16; 1 Pet 2:25; 5:1-4; Jude 1:12; Rev 7:17",

    "content": "God’s Presence in the Psalms\nScripture writers often express the desire to experience God’s presence. In the intimate experience of his presence, God’s rich goodness and love are all that people need (see Ps 21:6). By the same token, the absence of God’s presence is distressing and damaging.\nThe poets of Israel often spoke of God’s face as a way of expressing his presence or absence. So they sought his face (24:6; 105:4). When his face shone or was turned toward his people, they experienced his presence in blessing, provision, and protection (67:1; 80:3-19). God’s hiding his face from his people was a picture of divine abandonment (13:1; 27:9; 44:24; 69:17; 88:14; 89:46; 102:2; 104:29; 143:7), as if God were not seeing or hearing them (10:11; 42:3). The absence of God creates dismay, shame, and chaos, and may even lead to death (30:7; 44:24; 104:29).\nThe psalmists prayed for God’s presence as they requested a change in their circumstances (31:15-16; 67:1; 69:17; 80:3, 7, 19), and they acknowledged the role of his presence in giving them aid (see 44:3). The godly long to be invited into God’s presence (11:7; 16:9-11; 17:15). His presence alone satisfies their deepest longing (17:15) and gives them lasting pleasure (37:4; 43:4; 73:25). Everything about God delights them.\nGod’s favor and goodness are realized in his presence (23:6), as demonstrated in his people’s experiences of blessing, abundant crops, and prosperity (21:3; 65:11; 68:10; 85:12; 106:5; 128:2). Thus God’s goodness and the Temple—the place where his presence is especially manifest—are closely linked (65:4). God’s presence leads to health and vitality among his people, and he satisfies his people who are in need (107:9). For the psalmists, God’s presence was essential for flourishing.\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 4:6; 13:1; 21:6; 24:3-6; 27:9; 44:3, 24; 67:1; 69:17; 88:14; 89:46; 102:2; 104:29; 143:7",

    "content": "Wisdom Psalms\nSome psalms are called wisdom psalms because they make a case for the primary importance of wisdom or instruct readers in dealing with questions, issues, and doubts that arise in life (see Pss 1; 14; 25; 34; 37; 39; 49; 73; 78; 90; 91; 111; 112; 127; 128; 131; 133; 139). Many other psalms contain elements of wisdom teaching (see Pss 18; 27; 31; 32; 40; 62; 92; 94; 107; 144; 146).\nIn the other nations of the ancient Near East, wisdom had to do with maintaining order, pleasing the gods and other people, and carefully observing life, society, and nature. In Israel, wisdom shares these concerns but is distinct in the centrality it gives to fear of the Lord. God alone is the center and focus of life, and proper fear of him opens the path of wisdom (111:10). Fear of the Lord is a disposition of absolute submission to and trust in the Lord (115:11; see also 40:3; 112:7), which leads to purity of life (19:9). Psalm 34 connects the fear of the Lord with abundant life.\nThe way of wisdom is the way of godliness. Psalm 1 invites all readers of the psalms to delight in God, his revelation, and the lifestyle that results from his care for the wise. The lives of the godly demonstrate inner consistency, growth, and beauty as they increasingly reflect God’s righteousness and justice, love and fidelity, compassion and grace. They practice godliness from the inside out.\nWisdom enlarges a person’s perspective on life. A wise person desires to see life from God’s point of view. This search means living in submission and trust under the sovereign King who maintains the order and harmony of creation. Seeking God encourages an orderly and peaceful life and motivates obedience (19:7; 25:12; 51:6; 112:1; 119:98-100). The wise imitate God, and their lives are full of joy even when they are suffering hardship. They praise the Lord amid all circumstances of life (see 22:23, 25), and they face life confidently because the Lord is with them (23:4; 27:1, 3; 33:18; 91:1-16).\nIn contrast to the way of the wise is the way of the fool, or the wicked. Such people perceive themselves as powerful and continually boast of their accomplishments. They do not accept limitations. They brag, oppress, steal, and deprive others of their happiness. They have no fear of the Lord (36:1; 55:19). The poets of Israel repeatedly warned the people to be wary of the path of folly, lest God’s judgment overtake them (2:10-11; 94:8-10).\nJesus Christ came into the world as God in the flesh, and he embodies all the qualities of wisdom. Through him, we can walk in the way of wisdom (Col 2:2-3).\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 1; 14; 25; 34; 37; 39; 49; 73; 78; 90; 91; 111; 112; 127; 128; 131; 133; 139",

    "content": "Questions and Doubt\nThe psalmists are not afraid to ask questions and express doubts. The number of questions in a psalm indicates the intensity of the mood or the significance of the issue at hand. The psalms with the greatest number of questions raise the important issues of God’s perceived abandonment (Ps 13; Pss 42–43; 74; 89) and the prosperity of the wicked (Ps 73).\nThe psalmists’ questions clarify life issues. Some questions ask whether the Lord is the true God (94:9-10) and why he seems to have abandoned the godly (77:7). Other questions call attention to the success of the wicked (10:13), the impotence of the godly (11:3), the election of Zion (68:16), the power of God (114:5-6; 147:17), the folly of the nations (2:1), and the issue of injustice (82:2). The psalmists question, examine, challenge, doubt, and occasionally despair over God’s seeming lack of concern.\nThe psalmists’ questions may also lead to praise and worship: “Who can list the glorious miracles of the Lord? Who can ever praise him enough?” (106:2). The question, “Who will come from Mount Zion to rescue Israel?” (53:6) calls attention to the answer: The Lord rescues his people. For many questions, the implied answer brings praise to the Lord: “Whom have I in heaven but you? I desire you more than anything on earth” (73:25; see also 89:8). Questions may also express wonder at God’s grace (8:4; 130:3; 144:3).\nAsking good questions can be the beginning of a dialogue with the Lord that leads us along the path of wisdom and results in worship and praise.\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 2:1; 4:2; 6:3; 10:1; 11:3; 13:1-6; 22:1; 35:17; 42:1-11; 43:1-5; 44:23-24; 53:6; 60:9-10; 68:16; 73:1–74:23; 77:8-9; 79:5; 80:4, 12; 82:2; 83:2; 85:5-6; 88:14; 89:1-52; 90:11, 13; 94:3-4, 16, 20; 101:2; 108:10-11; 114:5-6; 119:82, 84; 137:4; 147:17",

    "content": "Zion\nZion is the Hebrew name for the mountain in Jerusalem where the Temple was located (2 Sam 5:7; see also 2 Chr 3:1). Zion is used as a synonym for Jerusalem, and the NLT often translates Zion as “Jerusalem” (e.g., Pss 69:35; 87:2; 97:8; 132:13). Thus Zion can refer to the actual, physical city of Jerusalem that was destroyed in 586 BC (see 102:13; 126:1; 137:1) and again in AD 70.\nZion also signifies the city of God that transcends geographical location. Zion is God’s universal kingdom, the city in which he dwells (74:2; 76:2; 84:7; 135:21; see Isa 26). This city embodies trust, justice, righteousness, and commitment, for the Lord does not tolerate impurity, uncleanness, idolatry, injustice, or unrighteousness (Isa 1:21-28). The prophets and poets of Israel speak of the city of God as being more extensive than the physical city. The citizens of this city come from Judah, Israel, and the nations (see Ps 87:5-6; Heb 12:22-24). Zion is on a high mountain (Ps 48:2) at the center of God’s kingdom on earth (99:2; 132:13), and God’s throne is there (9:11). Therefore, godly prayers and praise focus on Zion (53:6; 65:1; 147:12; 149:2), and redemption is sought there (14:7; 20:2; 50:2; 53:6). David’s descendants are the legitimate heirs who rule over Zion to establish God’s universal kingdom (2:6; 110:2).\nZion is symbolic of God’s protection and blessings (Pss 46:4-11; 48:1-14; 51:18; 128:5; 134:3). Anyone who trusts in the Lord is as secure as Mount Zion (125:1), but those who reject the Lord also reject the security of Zion and have no future (129:5-8).\nThe New Testament speaks of Mount Zion as a heavenly Jerusalem, the spiritual home of those from all nations who have been reborn through faith in Jesus Christ (Heb 12:22-24; see also Gal 4:24-26; Rev 3:12; 21:2-4). Abraham looked forward in faith to “a city with eternal foundations” (Heb 11:10), a city in which all men and women of faith are citizens (Heb 12:22-24). Because the Lord knows no geographical limitations (1 Kgs 8:27), the true Zion he inhabits is the hearts of all who worship him.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 5:7; 1 Kgs 8:1; Pss 14:7; 48:1-14; 50:2; 51:18; 68:16; 78:68; 87:2, 5; 125:1; 128:5; 132:13; 133:3; 135:21; 147:12; Isa 1:27; 2:3; 3:16-17, 26; 4:3-5; 8:18; 10:12, 24, 32; 16:1; 24:23; 29:8; 30:19; 31:4, 9; 33:20; 37:22, 32; 40:9; 41:27; 52:1-2; 60:14; 62:1; 64:10; Jer 26:18; 51:35; Lam 2:13; Joel 2:32; 3:16-17; Amos 1:2; Obad 1:21; Mic 3:12; 4:2; Zeph 3:14, 16; Zech 1:14, 17; 2:7; 8:2-3; 9:9; Heb 12:22; Rev 14:1",

    "content": "Trusting God in the Psalms\nThe Lord’s love leads people to trust in him (13:5; 17:7; 21:7; 32:10; 36:7; 52:8; 143:8). His name and reputation also encourage people’s trust (9:10; 20:7; 33:21). The godly reject idolatry and any commitment that detracts from their absolute trust in the Lord (31:6, 14; 44:6; 49:6-13; 52:7). Trust in the Lord is a form of wisdom that rejects folly and evil and pursues the Lord’s way (31:19; 37:3, 5; 115:11).\nFor the godly, every adversity in life is an occasion for growth in trust (9:9; 25:2; 46:1; 55:23; 57:1; 59:16; 62:8; 78:7). The godly are not afraid of life’s circumstances (56:3-4, 11; 112:7) but grow more confident in the midst of them (112:7; 125:1).\nThe Lord rescues, cares for, and rewards his people who trust in him (see 7:1; 16:1; 25:20; 26:1; 31:1-2, 4, 19; 34:22; 37:39-40; 86:2). They are blessed (2:12; 22:4-5; 34:8; 40:4; 84:12) as they long for God’s redemption (37:7, 34; 38:15; 40:1; 119:166; 130:5-6).

    "content": "Music in Ancient Israel\nThe earliest nomadic peoples made music. The first musician mentioned in the Bible is “Jubal, the first of all who play the harp and flute” (Gen 4:21). Music was significant from the beginning of Israel’s worship in the Tabernacle. In Exodus 28:34-35, Aaron’s robe is described as having bells attached to the lower hem that sounded as he entered the Holy Place. Scripture records several songs created by the people of God (e.g., Exod 15:1-21; Deut 31:30–32:44; Judg 5:1-31).\nThe first liturgical music mentioned in the Old Testament is in the narrative of the transfer of the Ark—David and the Israelites sang, played instruments, and danced to the glory of the Lord (2 Sam 6:5). David is recognized as making the musical instruments used in the Temple (2 Chr 7:6). In the postexilic era, the Levitical singers that are mentioned were the descendants of Asaph, the chief musician appointed by David (Ezra 2:41; Neh 7:44; 11:22-23). In short, Israel’s liturgical music and organization originated in the time of David.\nThe stately ceremony of the later services in Solomon’s Temple contrasts with the enthusiasm and spontaneity of David’s worship (2 Chr 7:1-6). Singers and musicians for worship at the Temple were chosen from the tribe of Levi (1 Chr 25:1, 7). They rotated their participation in the weekday, Sabbath, and high holy day services.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 4:21; Exod 28:34-35; 2 Sam 6:5; 2 Chr 7:6; Ps 71:22-23",

The wicked stir up his anger and deserve his judgment (see 2:5, 12; 21:9; 56:7; 59:13; 69:24; 79:6; see also Rom 1:18). And while he is patient and slow to anger (86:15; 103:8; 145:8), he ultimately will not allow evil to remain unchecked.\nThe psalmists understood Israel’s exodus from Egypt as an object lesson about God’s anger. God expressed his anger against the Egyptians while sparing his people (Ps 78:49-50). But Israel itself became the object of God’s anger during the wilderness journey, when the people provoked the Lord through their rebelliousness (78:31; 106:29, 32). As a result, God took an oath: That rebellious generation would not enter his place of rest (95:8-11). So they died in the wilderness. But he restrained his anger and did not destroy Israel as they deserved (78:38). Similarly, throughout the period of the judges and the monarchy, God’s people were marked by disobedience and evil; subsequently, in his wrath, God allowed them to be controlled by foreign powers, who sent them into exile (2 Kgs 17:5-23; 24:20–25:21). But again, God did not allow his people to be completely destroyed.\nWhen God’s people sin and experience his anger, it can precipitate repentance, in which case the experience, though painful, can lead to great joy in God’s mercy and goodness (Ps 30:5; see also Heb 12:5-11).\nThe New Testament makes clear that all of humanity was subject to God’s wrath on account of sin (Eph 2:1-3). But in his love, God sent his son, Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins and reconcile us to God (Rom 5:6-11; Eph 2:4-5). Those who turn to God in faith will thus escape the punishment that is coming at the future judgment of the world. In the end, Jesus will serve as the agent of God’s anger against the wicked (Pss 2:5-9; Rev 6:15-17; 19:11-16), who—along with God’s ultimate enemy, the devil—will be dealt with decisively (Rev 20:7-15).\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 2:5-9, 12; 6:1; 7:6, 11-13; 21:9; 27:9; 30:5; 38:1-10; 74:1; 78:18-64; 79:5-6; 80:4; 85:2-7; 86:15; 90:9-11; 95:8-11; 102:10-11; 103:8-9; 106:21-43; 110:5-7; 145:8; Isa 64:9-12; Lam 5:19-22; Rom 2:5-11; Eph 5:6; Rev 6:15-17; 11:18; 19:11-16",

    "content": "Making Sense of the Exile\nIsrael’s kings and the people of Israel repeatedly rebelled against God and broke their covenant with him. God therefore declared that he would bring the curses of the covenant upon them (see Deut 28:15-68; cp. Jer 4:13; Amos 5:11; Mic 6:14-15). God sent the Assyrian and Babylonian armies to execute this sentence, and a large number of the Israelites were taken into exile (see 2 Kgs 24:1–25:21).\nThe Exile shaped many of the psalms; we see its impact working behind the scenes in various images and themes. In Psalm 89 the grief, anguish, and confusion of the Exile are distilled into several questions that the psalmist raises: Has God abandoned David’s royal line (89:38-39)? How long will God’s anger last (Ps 89:46)? Does God understand human frailty (89:47-48)? Is God true to his nature (89:49)? Is God just in not avenging his people (89:50-51)?\nThese questions were on the minds of God’s people during and after the Exile. Some of their doubts raise questions concerning God’s ability to rule. Rather than dismissing these questions, wise readers listen, reflect, and study the answers that Scripture gives.\nThe definitive answer came in the Lord Jesus Christ (see Isa 52–54; Luke 1:46-55, 67-79; 4:18-19; Rom 6:6, 16-23; Heb 12:22-24). But those who experienced the Exile could only dimly foresee a hopeful future. They asked these hard questions and lived without clear answers.\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 26:27-45; Deut 28:36-37, 63-68; 30:1-5; 2 Kgs 17:5-23; 24:1–25:21; Ezra 5:12; Pss 89; 107; 126; Isa 5:13; 27:13; 52:1-12; 59:10; Jer 2:37; 3:18; 4:13; Ezek 6:9; 20:41; 37:1-14; Amos 5:11; Mic 6:14-15",

    "content": "The Creator-King\nGod created and established the world; the whole of creation is his handiwork (Gen 1–2; Ps 24:1-2; 95:4-5). He also rules over his creation, governing and caring for all that he has made (95:6-7; 96:10).\nSeveral psalms celebrate the manifestation of God’s glory in creation (Pss 8; 19; 28; 33; 89; and 104). Psalm 8 centers on God’s endowing human beings with splendor and vesting them as his rulers in creation. Psalm 19 encourages reflection on creation in order to cultivate wisdom. Psalm 29 reveals God’s power in the world and the stability of his creation. Psalm 33 exalts God’s governance, order, and wisdom in creation and underscores the importance of fearing the Lord. In Psalm 89, God’s covenant with David is founded on God’s commitment to creation (89:9-18).\nPsalms 93–100 reflect on God’s worldwide dominion. The earth belongs to him, and the Creator has demonstrated his power in history. Psalm 104 is a creation hymn that reworks the six days of creation into a marvelous lyric in praise of God’s wisdom.\nScripture calls upon all nations to acknowledge and praise God and to show their acceptance of his sovereign rule (see 9:11; 47:1-2, 7-9; 66:8; 117:1).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:1–2:4; Pss 8; 19; 28; 29; 33; 89; 93–100; 104; Eccl 12:1-7, 13-14; Isa 40:25-28; 43:15; 44:24; 51:13; Jer 10:16; Acts 4:23-31; Col 3:10",

    "content": "Darkness and Light\nDarkness\nDarkness is the absence of light. There was no light until God commanded that light appear. He then made a distinction between light and its absence (Gen 1:2, 4-5, 18). The ninth plague on Egypt was three days of intense darkness, a complete absence of light (Exod 10:21-23).\nThere is a darkness surrounding God (Exod 20:21; Deut 4:11; 5:23; 2 Sam 22:12; Ps 18:11; 97:2); he dwells in thick darkness (1 Kgs 8:12 // 2 Chr 6:1), and thick darkness is under his feet (2 Sam 22:10 // Ps 18:9). God is unknowable unless he reveals himself.\nDarkness often stands for distress and anxiety, or for the confusion and destruction experienced by the wicked (Gen 15:12; Job 12:25; 19:8; Pss 35:6; 107:10, 14; Eccl 5:17; Isa 5:30).\nFor Job, darkness was like nothingness (Job 3:4-6). It points to death, a land of shadows and gloom, the dwelling place of the dead far from the light of day (Job 10:21-22; 17:12-13; Eccl 6:4).\nEvil takes place under the cover of darkness (Job 24:16-17), but darkness cannot be a hiding place from God (Ps 139:11-12; Isa 29:15-16). Darkness often depicts ignorance of God’s will: Knowledge of God is “light,” so lack of knowledge is “darkness” (Job 12:24-25; Matt 4:16; John 1:5; 8:12; 12:35, 46; 1 Jn 1:5; 2:8-9, 11). Moral depravity is described as darkness (Prov 2:13; 4:19; Isa 5:20; 60:2). In the New Testament, darkness is also a metaphor for spiritual ignorance (Matt 4:16; 6:23; Luke 1:79; 11:35; Rom 2:19; Col 1:13). Those who come to know God come out of darkness (Isa 9:2).\nA major theme of the Old Testament prophets was the Day of the Lord, which was often associated with darkness (Ezek 32:8; Joel 2:2, 31; Amos 5:18, 20; Zeph 1:15). The New Testament also links darkness with judgment (Matt 8:12; 22:13; 25:30; 2 Pet 2:17; Jude 1:6, 13).\nLight\nLight was the first thing God created after the heavens and earth (Gen 1:3; see also 1:16). It is a natural symbol for what is pleasant, good, or uplifting (Eccl 11:7; Jas 1:17). When the Israelites left Egypt, they were led by a pillar of cloud and fire that gave them light (Exod 13:21; 14:20) and showed them the way to go (Neh 9:19). Light symbolizes the blessing of the Lord (Job 12:22; 29:2-3; Pss 4:6; 18:28; 44:3; 118:27). God’s servants can extend this blessing by being a light to guide others (Isa 42:6; 49:6). God’s light also exposes sin and brings justice (see Ps 90:8; Isa 51:4).\nGod himself is described as light (Ps 27:1; Isa 60:19-20; Dan 2:22; 1 Jn 1:5), and he dwells in unapproachable light (see 1 Tim 6:16). Yet he brings his servants into the light (Mic 7:8-9; see also 1 Jn 1:7).\nJesus said, “I am the light of the world” (John 8:12; 9:5; 12:46). He brought a revelation (light) from God, but he was more than a revealer—he was himself that revelation (John 1:1-10). Those who receive Jesus, who believe in the Light, receive the right to become children of God (John 1:9-12). They are illumined by his light and come to know God and his salvation (Matt 4:16; Luke 2:32; Acts 13:47; 26:18). They are “children of the light” (John 12:36; 1 Thes 5:5), their allegiance is to the light (1 Jn 1:7), and their conduct is characterized by light—by “what is good and right and true” (Eph 5:8-9).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:3-5, 14-18; 15:12; Exod 10:21-23; 14:20; 20:21; 2 Sam 22:10-13; 1 Kgs 8:12; Job 3:3-7; 12:22-25; 15:22; 17:12-13; 34:22; Pss 18:11, 28; 27:1; 97:2-6; 139:11-12; Prov 2:13; 4:18-19; Eccl 11:7-8; Isa 5:20; 9:2; 29:15; 51:4; 60:2-3, 19-20; Dan 2:22; Mic 7:8-9; Matt 4:16; 6:22-23; 8:12; Luke 1:78-79; 2:32; John 1:4-9; 8:12; 9:5; 12:35-36, 46; Acts 13:47; 26:18; Rom 2:19-20; Eph 5:7-14; 1 Thes 5:5-8; 1 Tim 6:16; Jas 1:17; 2 Pet 2:17; 1 Jn 1:5-7; 2:7-11",

    "content": "Praise Psalms\nThe Hebrew title of the book of Psalms means “Praises,” and that title accurately defines a large number of the psalms. God is praised throughout the psalms for his nature and for his great acts in creation and history. Praise psalms were written for individual use and for the community.\nIndividual praise (Pss 9; 18; 32; 34; 116; 138). It was customary in Temple worship for people to give verbal thanks in front of the whole assembly whenever they made a vow offering or a thank offering (see, e.g., 22:22-26; 66:13-20; 116:17-19). Such opportunities for personal praise and testimony must have added warmth and significance to worship. Each act of rescue and every experience of God’s mercy became part of the cumulative, ongoing story of salvation. Worship was not simply a recital of God’s deeds in earlier centuries.\nCommunal praise (Pss 103, 113, 124, 129, 136). When the community gathered, they praised the Lord in song for his acts in history (Ps 103) or for a specific recent manifestation of his mercy (Pss 124, 129). In Psalm 103, the psalmist praises God for his mercy to each individual (103:1-5) and to the whole community (103:6-14). The frailty of humanity contrasts with God’s constancy (103:15-18); his universal and absolute rule merits universal praise (103:19-22).\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 9; 18; 32; 34; 46–48; 93; 96–99; 103; 113; 116; 124; 129; 136; 138",

    "content": "Prayers for Vengeance\nThe psalmists sometimes asked the Lord to execute vengeance against their adversaries. It was not unusual for a psalmist to pray for the violent destruction of their enemies as a manifestation of God’s justice. How can this kind of prayer be okay?\nThese prayers for the destruction of the wicked arose out of concern for justice and righteousness and out of confidence in God. Divine justice is defined in Psalm 1:6: The Lord loves the righteous and destroys the wicked. The wicked are subversive, corrupt, and thoroughly committed to evil; they live in opposition to God and to everything that God does. The wicked shake the foundations of ethics, of society, and of God’s kingdom. The psalmists argued that evil is inconsistent with God’s nature and that the removal of evil is the only way for his kingdom to thrive. However, the poets of Israel did not simply invoke God’s judgment on anyone with whom they could not get along. Instead, the psalmists were guided by God’s standards of justice and righteousness, to which God holds all humans accountable.\nThe psalmists were intimately acquainted with grief. They had suffered and been oppressed and marginalized by bullies, leaders, and kings from inside and outside of Israel. Their prayers were full of faith and hope, asking how long the Lord would tolerate their suffering and confessing that the Lord alone could rescue them from evil. They expressed deep longing for his redemption. By the principle of retribution, they asked the Lord to inflict upon the wicked the suffering that they had endured (Ps 5:10; 6:10; 7:9; 9:19-20; 28:4; 56:7; 104:35; 137:7-9; 139:19). Through these prayers for justice and vindication, the godly may rest in peace as they await God’s rescue.\nDo we truly see evil as evil, or do we perceive it merely as an inconvenience? Prayers for the end of evil are appropriate as long as we recognize God as arbiter, judge, and executor. The prayer for the coming of God’s Kingdom implies the removal of evil. But now the cruelty inflicted on the wicked has been transformed through the cruel crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This act of God informs how we pray for those who oppose us. Jesus will indeed judge and bring an ultimate end to evil (see Rev 19:11-21), but while Christians await that final judgment, they are to love as Christ loved (John 13:34), pray for their enemies, and forgive them (Matt 5:38-48; Col 3:13).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Chr 24:22; Neh 4:5; Pss 3:7; 9:19-20; 10:15; 12:3; 41:10; 55:15; 69:22-28; 79:6; 109:6-20; 110:5-6; 137:1-9; Isa 61:2; Jer 11:20-23; 18:19-23; 51:35; Lam 1:22; 3:64-66; Acts 1:20; Rom 11:9-10; Rev 6:10",

    "content": "The Heart in the Psalms\nThe Hebrew words leb and lebab (both meaning “heart”) are hard to translate because they rarely refer to the physical human heart. Rather, these terms usually refer to the center of one’s being, an image for a person’s thought life, reflections, and will. The story of the heart reveals a person’s commitment and direction in life.\nThe hearts of the wicked are cunning and scheming (Ps 58:2; 64:6; 140:2). The wicked are deceptive, hypocritical, greedy, jealous, and lacking in integrity (10:3; 28:3; 41:6; 55:21; 62:4; 141:4). As time goes on, they become more arrogant, callous, and stubborn (14:1; 17:10; 73:7; 78:8; 81:12; 95:8, 10; 101:5; 119:70). The wicked are only committed to themselves (78:37), and their destructive way of life (5:9) leads to their own destruction.\nMeanwhile, the psalmists openly confess their sorrow, trouble, anguish, and despair (13:2; 22:14; 25:17; 38:8, 10; 40:12; 55:4; 61:2; 69:20; 73:21, 26; 109:22; 143:4; 147:3). Through their pain, their hearts grow. They pray intensely (62:8; 119:145), long for God (84:2), trust in him (28:7), and open their hearts to God’s examination (7:9; 17:3; 26:2; 139:1-6, 23). Their commitment does not waver, and their hearts are pure (24:4; 51:10; 73:1, 13) and contented (131:1), even when broken. As their broken hearts (34:17-18; 51:17) are healed by the Lord (147:3), they become strong, confident (27:3, 14; 31:24; 57:7; 108:1; 112:7-8; 138:3), and full of life (22:26; 69:32). In the end, the Lord satisfies them and gives them the desires of their hearts (20:4; 21:2; 37:4). This fills the godly with joy and praise (4:7; 9:1; 13:5; 16:7, 9; 19:8; 30:11-12; 33:21; 86:12; 89:50; 102:4; 105:3; 111:1; 119:7, 111; 138:1).\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 7:9; 9:1; 13:2; 14:1; 16:7-9; 17:3; 19:8; 20:4; 21:2; 22:14, 26; 24:4; 26:2; 27:3, 14; 28:3, 7; 33:21; 34:17-18; 37:4; 38:8, 10; 51:10, 17; 55:4, 21; 57:7; 58:2; 61:2; 62:4, 8-10; 64:6; 69:20; 73:1, 7, 13, 21, 26; 78:8, 37; 81:12; 84:2; 86:12; 89:50; 95:8, 10; 102:4; 108:1; 109:22; 111:1; 119:70, 111, 145; 131:1; 138:1; 139:1-24; 140:2; 147:3",

    "content": "Fear of the Lord\nAs Moses is giving final instructions to the people of Israel prior to his death, he exhorts the people several times to “fear the Lord” (see, e.g., Deut 6:1-13; 10:12-21; 31:9-13). Joshua gives the same directive near the end of his life (Josh 24:14). Fear implies respect, awe, and at times, knee-knocking terror. Fear of the Lord encompasses a continual attentiveness to his sovereignty and power. For the Israelites to fear the Lord, it would mean an acknowledgment that everything needed for success comes from total dependence on God.\nThe main theme of Proverbs can be summed up in the ten words that appear near the beginning of the book: “Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge” (Prov 1:7). The fear of the Lord leads people toward humility and away from pride (3:7; 15:33). With such an attitude, people are more apt to listen to God than to their own independent judgment. Fear of the Lord recognizes God’s central place in the order of the world. God is the Creator and Master of all things. This is why Psalm 14:1 labels those who reject God as “fools”. Those who fear the Lord receive wisdom because they begin to understand that everything is under God’s rule and in his service. This is more than just an attitude; it is a way of living that takes into account God’s power and authority and our ultimate accountability to him.\nWisdom is closely connected to a proper relationship with God—both require choices in line with God’s character (see Job 28:28; Prov 14:2; Eccl 12:13). Do you want wisdom? Then you must enter into a relationship with the one who has all wisdom (see 1 Cor 1:1–2:16; Col 2:3).\nPassages for Further Study\nJob 28:28; Pss 14:1; 111:10; Prov 1:7; 3:7; 8:13; 9:10; 10:27; 14:2, 26-27; 15:16, 33; 19:23; 22:4; Eccl 12:13; Isa 11:1-2; 33:6",

    "content": "Wisdom\nWisdom helps us know how to speak and act in different situations. It provides the ability to avoid problems as well as the skill to handle them when they arise. Wisdom goes beyond simple intelligence. Proverbs notes that even animals such as ants, hyraxes, locusts, and lizards (Prov 30:24-28) are wise. This is not because they have great intelligence but because they know how to navigate life skillfully.\nThe foundation of wisdom is God himself. No wisdom exists apart from fear of the Lord (1:7). Wisdom is closely connected to righteousness and remains distant from evil. According to Proverbs, wisdom is gained through observation and experience (6:6-8), from instruction based on tradition (22:17-21), in learning from mistakes (12:1), and finally, but most importantly, through divine revelation (see 1:7).\nIn 1 Corinthians 1–2, Paul contrasts the “wisdom” of the world (which he calls foolishness) with the wisdom of Christ. Paul also says of Jesus, “In him lie hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col 2:3). The wisdom that comes from God is evidenced in the lives of believers by their goodness, humility, purity, and peace (Jas 3:13-18).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 1:13-18; 4:5-8; 1 Kgs 3:1-28; Job 12:12; 28:20-28; Pss 90:12; 119:98; Prov 1:7; 2:1-22; 30:24-28; Eccl 2:12-16; 7:4-19; Isa 11:1-2; Jer 9:23-24; 10:12; Hos 14:9; Luke 7:35; 1 Cor 3:18-20; Jas 1:5; 3:13-17; Rev 7:12",

    "content": "Marriage and Sexuality\nFrom the beginning of Scripture, marriage is considered sacred, and appropriate sexual expression is an important part of marriage (Gen 2:23-25). The Fall created a rupture in all relationships, first between God and humans, and then between husband and wife (Gen 3). The division between Adam and Eve was expressed in terms of their sexuality; they could no longer stand naked in the garden without feeling shame.\nIn Proverbs, the wise teacher frequently warns naive young men to avoid the temptations of sexual expression outside of marriage (Prov 2:16-22; 5:1-23; 6:20–7:27). While a young man might find other women physically attractive and seductive, the consequences of acting on these temptations are dire: His family and professional aspirations might be destroyed. Proverbs teaches young men to cultivate a strong relationship with their own wives. They are counseled to have healthy marital sex rather than sleeping with other women (5:15-20).\nAlthough this section of Proverbs was originally written to instruct young men, all readers can reflect on these issues of marriage and sexuality. Proverbs urges men and women to recognize the sanctity and beauty of marital love as God, the wise Creator, intended it.\nThe New Testament reaffirms the sacredness of sexuality and its proper expression in marriage. Jesus appeals to the creation narrative in Genesis as a way of highlighting the intended permanency of the marriage relationship. After quoting Genesis 2:24, he states, “Since they are no longer two but one, let no one split apart what God has joined together” (Matt 19:3-6). Paul discusses the importance of maintaining sexual intimacy in marriage, lest Satan be afforded an opportunity to tempt (1 Cor 7:3-5). God’s desire is that those who join in marriage would remain faithful to one another, avoiding sexual activity that is destructive to the sacred relationship they have entered (see Heb 13:4).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 2:18-25; Prov 2:16-22; 5:15-20; 6:20-35; 7:1-27; Jer 5:7-11; Hos 2:20; Mal 2:14-16; Matt 19:4-6; 22:30; 1 Cor 6:15-20; Heb 13:4",

    "content": "Speaking\nAs children we probably heard, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” Scripture presents another viewpoint: Words have the power of life and death (18:21). The words contained in lies (14:5, 25), arguments (26:17), insults (20:20), slander (10:18), gossip (11:13), rumors (18:8), flattery (7:21-22), and bragging (26:23; 27:2) can all be death-dealing.\nProverbs repeatedly emphasizes that foolish people speak foolish words. They are represented by “the woman named Folly” (9:13-18), who lies and deceives to harm her hearers. Words reflect the condition of the heart (16:23; 18:4). While someone might conceal an evil heart by using pleasant words (26:23), a person’s true character will eventually surface (26:24-26). The words of fools not only harm others; these words ultimately injure those who speak them. The tongue is full of wickedness that can ruin your whole life (Jas 3:6).\nIn contrast, wise people speak the life-giving words represented by Wisdom (Prov 8:7-9; 10:11). Wise people use their words sparingly (17:27-28) and are usually gentle (15:4; 16:24). However, a wise person also knows the right time to speak (15:23; 25:11) and realizes that, at times, even harsh criticism is necessary (see 27:5). Proverbs wisely reminds its readers to pay close attention not only to what they say but also to how and when they say it.\nPassages for Further Study\nProv 7:21-22; 8:7-9; 9:13-18; 10:11, 18; 11:13; 14:5, 25; 15:4, 23; 16:23-24; 17:28; 18:4, 21; 20:20; 25:11; 26:17, 23-26; 27:2, 5; Matt 12:33-37; Jas 3:1-12",

    "content": "Anger\nWise people do not fly off the handle in anger. “People with understanding control their anger; a hot temper shows great foolishness” (Prov 14:29). Because anger can cloud judgment, it is vitally important for the wise to reflect on their actions before responding (14:16).\nAlthough the book of Proverbs comments on anger only in a negative light, Scripture does not portray all anger as bad. Many psalms express anger (e.g., Ps 77), and Jesus became angry as he threw the money changers out of the Temple (Mark 11:15-17; John 2:13-16). People must learn to distinguish righteous anger from unrighteous anger, though it is often hard to tell the two apart. Unrighteous anger is only concerned to protect or promote oneself (e.g., Gen 4:3-8; 1 Sam 18:8-9; 1 Kgs 21:3-4; 2 Kgs 5:11; 2 Chr 25:10; Jon 4). Righteous anger reflects God’s hatred of evil and love of justice (e.g., Exod 32; Num 11:1, 10; see also Nah 1:3; Rom 9:22). The wise person reads the circumstances and discerns whether and to what degree to express anger (see also Prov 22:24; Eccl 7:9; Matt 5:22; Rom 12:19; Eph 4:26-27, 31; Jas 1:19-20).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 18:8-11; 1 Kgs 21:3-16; Pss 30:5; 37:8; Prov 12:16; 14:29; 15:1, 18; 16:14; 19:11-12, 19; 22:24-25; 27:4; Eccl 7:9; Nah 1:2-3; Matt 5:22; Eph 4:26-27, 31-32; 1 Tim 2:8; Titus 1:7; Jas 1:19-21",

    "content": "Wealth and Poverty in the Wisdom Literature\nThe sayings in Scripture about wealth and poverty, particularly in the wisdom literature, are individual snapshots of a broad truth: God blesses the wise with wealth (3:9-10, 15-16; 10:22), making life’s difficulties more manageable (10:15), while foolish behavior—especially laziness—leads to poverty (see 10:4).\nThe book of Proverbs readily acknowledges that some wicked fools are wealthy, but it also reminds us that this kind of wealth will not last long (11:18; 13:11). Poverty can sometimes result from injustice (13:23) rather than foolishness, and wealth sometimes comes from injustice and dishonesty (16:8). Those who have wealth need to use it wisely, which includes generosity to those in need (28:27; 29:7, 14).\nThe benefits of wealth are limited. Occasionally, wealth produces problems rather than solving them (11:4; 13:8). Because wisdom can help where wealth cannot, wisdom is much more important than money (15:16-17; 16:8, 16).\nAll things being equal, the godly will be rewarded with material blessings and the opportunity to be generous. However, all things are not equal. Sometimes wealth does not go to the deserving (see Eccl 9:11), nor does it necessarily produce satisfaction (see Eccl 2:17-23; 5:10-17). In fact, money can be detrimental to faith (1 Tim 6:10; Jas 2:1-13). When a choice must be made between godliness and money, the wise will choose godliness.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 6:10-13; 8:10-11; 1 Sam 2:7; Ps 37:16; Prov 3:9-10, 15-16; 10:15, 22; 11:4, 18, 28; 13:8, 11; 14:24; 15:6, 16-17; 16:8, 16; 23:4-5; 28:27; 29:7, 14; Eccl 5:10-17; 1 Tim 6:10",

Yet bribes can be used for good purposes and may even be encouraged (17:8; 18:16; 21:14).\nAs with other topics in Proverbs, the teaching on bribery may seem contradictory, but these proverbs all ring true when applied to the right circumstances, which seem to be connected to the reason for which a bribe or gift is given. If someone gives a bribe so that a judge will condemn an innocent person or set a guilty person free, then it is an evil bribe (see Exod 23:8; Deut 16:19; 27:25; Ps 15:5). However, if a bribe helps an innocent person to find justice or serves some good purpose, then it seems to be allowable. An example of the latter from modern times might be a “gift” to a foreign immigration official that expedites the processing of a visa for a missionary.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 23:8; Deut 10:17; 16:19; 1 Sam 8:1-3; Prov 17:8, 23; 18:16; 29:4; Eccl 7:7; Isa 1:23; 33:14-16; Amos 5:12; Mic 3:9-12; 7:3; Matt 28:11-15",

This observation motivates parents to guide their children into wisdom and encourages children to pay attention to wise instruction (19:26-27).\nWhen children need discipline, parents should not shirk their responsibility, because the consequences are dangerous to the child (19:18; 22:15; 23:13-14). Through the example of their own wise and godly behavior, parents are to instruct their children in the ways of the Lord (Deut 6:1-25; Prov 20:7; 22:6), and they are to inform them about his great deeds in history (Ps 78:1-8). This knowledge will lead children to obedience and blessing. Children, for their part, must show godly parents the respect that is due to them (Prov 20:20; 30:11-14, 17).\nProverbs affirms the power and impact of a strong, cohesive family that loves and follows God. The book has strong warnings for those who would disrupt a family (6:16-19; 11:29), and it heaps great praise on those who build up the family (see 14:1).

    "content": "Laziness and Hard Work\nGod created Adam and Eve and put them in the Garden to tend it, not just to sit back and enjoy it (Gen 2:15). Work is not a result of the Fall but rather is a dignified and important part of creation.\nThe book of Proverbs frequently condemns laziness. The lazy are sarcastically compared to a door that swings back and forth (26:14), and they are lampooned for their empty excuses (e.g., 22:13). Proverbs equates lazy people with the foolish; their lack of productivity leads to poverty and death (6:6-10; 10:26; 15:19; 18:9; 19:15, 24; 20:4; 21:25; 22:13; 24:30-34; 26:13-16). By contrast, diligent people are seen as wise; their activities lead to wealth and life (10:4-6; 12:11; 13:4; 20:13; 31:10-27).\nWhile it is true that ultimate meaning and fulfillment do not come from hard work (Eccl 2:17-26), and that our hard work must not cause us to forget God’s ability to provide (see Ps 127:2), we still have no excuse to be lazy. God designed us to use the gifts and abilities he has given us to be productive and to provide, as we are able, for ourselves and others (see Eph 4:28; 1 Thes 4:11-12; 2 Thes 3:6-13).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 23:12; Prov 6:6-11; 10:4-6, 26; 12:11, 24, 27; 13:4, 11; 14:4, 23; 15:19; 18:9; 19:15; 21:5, 25; 24:30-34; 26:13-16; 28:19; 31:10-31; Eccl 2:18-26; 4:5-6; 5:12; 9:10; 11:4-6; Rom 12:11; Eph 4:28; 1 Thes 4:11-12; 2 Thes 3:10-15",

    "content": "Pride and Humility\nPride is a natural human response to success and achievement, and the world places great value on recognition and fame (see 1 Jn 2:16). Yet, pride is rooted in self-centeredness, and it often exists side by side with the diminishment of others. Scripture frequently cautions against pride and its destructive results, encouraging instead an attitude of humility.\nThe book of Proverbs links humility with wisdom (see Prov 11:2), which has its foundation in the fear of the Lord (1:7), a recognition of God’s sovereignty and centrality. A humble person is able to recognize their mistakes and listen to another’s correction (10:17; 12:1). Pride, meanwhile, can block one’s ability to learn from others, leads to conflict (13:10), and results in disgrace (11:2).\nIn the divine economy, pride results in destruction and humiliation while humility leads to honor (16:18; 18:12; 29:23). When Jesus was asked “Who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” he responded by pointing to the exemplary humility of a little child (Matt 18:1-5). On another occasion, Jesus told a parable that contrasted the prideful prayer of a religious leader and the humble prayer of a tax collector, concluding with the words, “Those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted” (Luke 18:9-14; see also Matt 23:8-12; Luke 14:7-11).\nJesus himself provided the ultimate example in humility. Though being God’s son, he “did not think of equality with God as something to cling to,” but rather he “took the humble position of a slave” and “humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal’s death on a cross” (Phil 2:6-8). God calls us to display the same kind of self-sacrificial humility in our own lives (Phil 2:3-5; 1 Jn 3:16).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 3:5-14; 2 Chr 26:14-20; Prov 10:17; 11:2; 12:15; 15:5; 22:4; 29:23; Matt 5:5; 18:4; 21:5; Luke 18:9-14; Eph 4:2; Phil 2:3; Jas 1:21; 3:13; 4:10",

    "content": "All Is “Vapor”\nA key word in Ecclesiastes is the Hebrew term hebel (“vapor,” often translated “meaningless”). This word expresses the core of the Teacher’s judgment concerning life in this world.\nAt its root, hebel means physical “breath” or “vapor.” Hebel is used seventy-eight times in the Old Testament, but in only three instances is the physical meaning clearly intended (Ps 62:9; Prov 21:6; Isa 57:13). In the other seventy-five instances, the word is used metaphorically to describe what is incomprehensible, futile, meaningless, false, transitory, or insubstantial. The term is often used to describe the insubstantiality, unreality, and worthlessness of false gods (Deut 32:21; 2 Kgs 17:15). In this sense, hebel is the opposite of “glory”—the substantial, weighty, and lasting presence of God. Sometimes the word hebel stands for the way life is fleeting and momentary, like vapor (Job 7:16; Ps 144:4). In other cases, it refers to the meaninglessness and frustration of life (Pss 78:33; 94:11; Isa 49:4).\nThere is a long tradition of understanding hebel in Ecclesiastes as meaning “vanity,” not in the sense of thinking too highly of oneself, but in the sense of experiencing life as futile and without purpose or meaning. The ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament used the word mataiotēs, which means “emptiness” or “futility.” The Latin Vulgate then translated hebel with the Latin word vanitas, which means “purposelessness, pointlessness, hollowness, worthlessness.” From the Vulgate comes the long-standing tradition of translating the word as “vanity” in English. Most translators today understand the word hebel in this sense: Life on earth has no apparent purpose or meaning, and all that we do is futile.\nSome translators, however, understand hebel in Ecclesiastes to be referring primarily to the transitory impermanence of life. Vapor has no permanence or weight. This translation leads to a different understanding of Ecclesiastes: Life is not so much meaningless and futile as it is impermanent and fleeting. Many phrases in Ecclesiastes allude to the fleeting nature of human life and its efforts. In the New Testament, a similar thought can be found in James 4:13-15. The understanding of hebel as “impermanence” in Ecclesiastes has merit in explaining the book coherently; it is, however, a minority view among scholars.\nThe NLT translates hebel in Ecclesiastes as “meaningless.” However, while reading Ecclesiastes, it is helpful to keep in mind the root of the word (“breath” or “vapor”) that stands behind the metaphors.\nThe brevity, frustration, and apparent meaninglessness of life can be depressing. This discouragement should motivate us toward working more wisely and diligently and enjoying life while we can. We have all observed the apparent absurdity of life’s tragedies, such as the success of a wicked fool or unchecked injustice. But these things come into proportion when we remember God’s sovereignty, because “God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad” (Eccl 12:14).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 32:21; 2 Kgs 17:15; Job 7:16; Pss 62:9; 78:33; 94:11; 144:4; Prov 21:6; Eccl 1:2; Isa 30:7; 49:4; 57:13",

    "content": "Enjoying God’s Gifts\nThe conclusion of many of the Teacher’s reflections in Ecclesiastes is that we are responsible for enjoying life because it is God’s gift (see 2:24-25; 3:12-13, 22; 5:18; 6:9; 8:15; 9:7-9; 11:7-10). Although there are conditions in which it would seemingly be better not to be alive, life is meant to be enjoyed with laughing, dancing, love, and peace. It is especially worth living when old age and death challenge that joy (9:4, 10; 11:7-9; 12:1). We are to enjoy our food, drink, health, proper clothes, our loving spouse, children, daily work, and entertainment. It may be surprising to hear such joy in Ecclesiastes, a book that acknowledges such intense tragedy and frustration. But it is exactly this balance of joy and sorrow that characterizes the wise person who reflects on all of life and understands its complexities in a fallen world.\nIt is when we treat the things of life and their enjoyment as ends in themselves that they are deterrents to happiness. The Teacher speaks strongly against the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake as foolish and without profit (2:1-2; 7:4; 10:16-19; see also Isa 22:13; 56:12; Luke 12:19-20).\nThe New Testament encourages us to be joyful in all things, including trials and challenges (Phil 4:4; Jas 1:2). One tradition in Christianity states that “the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever” (Westminster Shorter Catechism, Question 1).\nPassages for Further Study\nEccl 2:24-25; 3:12-13, 22; 4:6; 5:18-20; 6:9; 8:15; 9:7-9; 11:7-10; Isa 22:13; 56:12; Luke 12:19-20; Phil 4:4; Col 2:20-22; Jas 1:2; 4:13-16",

Yet God knew that in spite of these striking realities, his people would be prone to forget him (Deut 31:16-21). Moses cautioned the people who were about to enter the Promised Land to never forget what the Lord had done for them (Deut 8:1-20). Sure enough the people of Israel forgot the Lord, which ultimately led to their exile from the land God had given them (see 2 Kgs 17:5-23; see also Jer 2:32).\nThe Teacher in Ecclesiastes likewise pointed to the importance of remembering the Lord. After reflecting throughout the book on the temporality and futility of numerous aspects of life, the Teacher concludes his observations by admonishing his readers to remember the one who is not fleeting (Eccl 12:1-7). No one is able to remain young forever; aging and death are a universal part of life. As such, the Teacher encourages people to focus on God while they are young—before it’s too late. God will hold each of us accountable for all that we do (Eccl 12:13-14); how we live in the present must be informed by the reality of his future judgment.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 8:1-20; Eccl 12:1-7, 13-14; 1 Cor 3:12-14",

The beauty and wonder of God’s creation is often reflected on in Scripture, particularly in the psalms (see, e.g., Ps 8:3-4; Ps 104:1-35).\nNature—and imagery from nature—also features prominently in the Song of Songs. The man and woman in the Song often express sexual intimacy in the countryside (2:8-17; 4:12–5:1; 6:2-3, 11-12), a place of pleasant fragrances and secluded meeting places. The garden, vineyard, and orchard create intimate and pleasant settings and evoke a romantic mood. The mystique of nature provides them with the environment in which their love is the most rustic, and at the same time the most exotic and exhilarating. Additionally, the couple uses extensive metaphors from nature to describe each other’s physical attributes and their arousing effects. Their portrayal of each other leads them to use illustrations from God’\nNature points people to the Creator, as it contains evidence of his power, goodness, justice, and love (see Ps 19:1-4; Rom 1:18-20).

People who parade their piety for others to see often have little desire to truly obey God.\nIsaiah preached to what seemed to be a very religious people. They fasted, said prayers, celebrated holy days, and brought their sacrifices to Jerusalem. Yet God rejected these practices. Why? These acts had value—the Lord himself had prescribed them! But the people’s worship was not from the heart, and it was not accompanied by the personal holiness and social justice that God requires (see, e.g., Lev 19:13-17). The people of Judah had fallen into the trap of religious hypocrisy.\nMany years after Isaiah, Jesus confronted this kind of hypocrisy in the Pharisees. He challenged them to be better doers of God’s whole revelation rather than just the parts that brought them acclaim (Matt 23:1-36, especially Matt 23:23). The apostles Paul and James also distinguished between mere religiosity and true spirituality (1 Cor 3:1-23; Jas 1:21–2:13). Jesus’ rebuke of the Pharisees also serves as a warning to us: We are not to be like them (see Matt 6:1-18; 1 Pet 2:1). Instead, Jesus calls us to be authentic before God and with others, to obey his entire word, and to go beyond mere formalities and appearances in our devotion to God.\nPassages for Further Study\nPs 50:16-23; Prov 15:8; 26:23; Isa 1:11-15; 29:13-15; 58:2-7; Jer 7:4-10; 12:2; Ezek 33:30-31; Hos 8:13; Amos 5:21-24; Mic 3:11; Zech 7:5-6; Mal 2:13-14; Matt 6:1-18; 23:1-36; Titus 1:15-16; Jas 1:21-27; 1 Pet 2:1; 1 Jn 2:4, 9; 4:20",

Israel’s history demonstrated this reality (see Exod 14:10-31; Josh 10:9-14). But for those who look elsewhere for peace and security, God can be a stumbling stone rather than a source of safety (Isa 8:14).\nDuring the reign of King Ahaz of Judah, when the king heard that Syria and Israel had allied against him, he trembled in fear (Isa 7:2). The Lord encouraged him to be a man of faith, because without faith he could not expect the Lord’s protection (7:9). However, Ahaz refused to trust the Lord. Rather, he turned to the Assyrians for help. As a result, the Lord became a trap for him, as well as for all Israel and Judah (8:11-15).\nOne of the purposes of Isaiah’s message was to highlight the contrast between faith and fear. We see Ahaz as an example of fear. We then see Hezekiah as an imperfect example of faith (see ch 37). Isaiah himself provides a better example of faith (ch 8). Finally, God’s servant stands as the ideal example of faith (42:1-7; 50:4-7).\nJesus instructed his followers not to fear those who threaten them—even those who wish to kill them (Matt 10:26-31). The same God who is aware of the happenings of each individual sparrow and who knows the number of hairs on a person’s head will be with those who trust in him. Such trust has been demonstrated by believers throughout history who have rejected the fear of what others can do to them—even to the point of martyrdom (see Acts 6:8–7:60).\nThose who do not commit themselves wholly to God will live in fear of others.

    "content": "Trusting God in Isaiah\nThe prophet Isaiah saw that mere humans prove untrustworthy (Isa 2:22). When in distress, the people of Judah often sought help from other nations (e.g., Egypt or Assyria), but Isaiah pointed out that Judah’s success and security was based upon their trust in God (see 8:9-17). King Hezekiah was mocked by the Assyrian army for trusting in God, yet it was that very trust that led to a great victory for God’s people (36:1–37:37).\nThose who trust in the Lord live in awe of him (29:23) and are not afraid (see 35:4), knowing that the Lord will be with them (51:12). They respond in praise because they trust in him (12:1-2; 25:9), and they express their trust through obedience to him (26:8). The faithful might feel the effects of God’s judgment on his enemies as they await the Lord’s salvation. Yet they find new strength day by day (40:31) and see themselves ultimately as citizens of God’s city, Zion (see 26:1-3). Those who trust in the Lord have true and lasting inner peace (26:3, 12; 32:17-18).\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 2:22; 7:4-9; 8:16-20; 12:1-2; 26:2-3, 12; 32:17-18; 35:4; 40:9-11, 28-31; 51:12",

    "content": "The Remnant\nIn the face of foreign invasion and the prospect of exile, the notion of the remnant was a source of hope for God’s people (see Mic 2:12-13; 4:6-8). While the Exile would be the outworking of God’s judgment on his people, God indicated that he would not completely destroy them (see Hos 11:8-11). The fact that a remnant was preserved demonstrated God’s mercy and faithfulness.\nThe theme of the remnant was integral to Isaiah’s message. In fact, one of his sons was named Shear-jashub, which means “a remnant will return” (Isa 7:3; see 10:21). Isaiah prophesied that when the Lord judged his people with destruction (which occurred at the hands of the Babylonians in 605–586 BC), he would save a small community—the remnant—to be the core of a new beginning. Because the population of Judah would be decimated (as the northern kingdom of Israel had been already), this remnant would be a very small beginning. It is depicted as a “branch” (4:2), a “stump” (6:13), a community of the “poor” and “needy” (25:4), and “handpicked grain” (27:12-13). This remnant was to put their trust in the Lord while waiting for him to establish his rule and come to reward them (see 3:10; 40:10). The Lord promised that this small community would swell into a huge multitude that would come out of both Israel and the Gentile nations (27:6; 60:3).\nIn fulfillment of prophecy, a remnant of God’s people were allowed to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple during the reign of King Cyrus of Persia (Ezra 1:2-4). Ezra the priest recognized this preservation of a remnant as purely an act of God’s grace, an act that could be jeopardized if the people followed their ancestors in disobedience (Ezra 9:5-15).\nThe notion of the remnant serves as an encouragement to remain faithful to God in the midst of the unfaithfulness of others. In the case of the people of Israel and Judah, such faithfulness would lead to the restoration of their land and to the blessings God had promised his people.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Kgs 19:31; 2 Chr 36:20; Ezra 9:14; Isa 1:8-9; 4:1-3; 6:13; 10:19-22; 11:10-16; 27:12-13; 28:5; 37:31-32; 46:3-4; Jer 6:9; 23:3-4; 31:7-8; Amos 5:15; Mic 2:12; 4:6-7; 5:7-8; 7:18; Zeph 3:11-13",

    "content": "The Day of the Lord\nThe expression day of the Lord refers to a time of retribution when God judges his enemies in wrath and fury. The ungodly receive the punishment they deserve, while the righteous enter into their full salvation (see Isa 3:16–4:6). On the day of the Lord, God manifests his awe-inspiring lordship over creation. When God comes in glory, humans experience terror (2:10, 19, 21) because all human support structures (religious, economic, military, social) come under his scrutiny.\nThis expression first appeared in the prophecy of Amos (Amos 5:18), but evidently it did not originate with him. Amos was correcting a popular misunderstanding that the Israelites already held. They believed that the day of the Lord would be a joyous day of salvation when God would intervene in the world to judge Israel’s enemies and reestablish Israelite rule over all of greater Canaan. But Amos warned the Israelites that the day of the Lord would not be light for them, but darkness, for they were in rebellion against him (see Amos 5:10-12, 21-27). Self-confident Israelites assumed that God was always on their side, but their sins had, in fact, made them God’s enemies, and they deserved his full punishment.\nThe expression became part of the standard vocabulary of the prophets, often being referred to simply as “that day” (e.g., Isa 2:11; 27:1; Zeph 1:8). In light of God’s warnings and the people’s sinfulness, the prophets envisioned that day as imminent (see, e.g., Joel 1:15; 2:1). As such, they hoped that their warnings would spur repentance among God’s people (see Zeph 2:1-3). Unfortunately, their warnings largely fell on deaf ears. The day of the Lord came for the northern kingdom when Assyria destroyed Samaria; it came for the southern kingdom when Babylon invaded in 605–586 BC and destroyed Jerusalem.\nWhile the day of the Lord is catastrophic for the ungodly—Joel compares its devastation to that of a locust plague (Joel 1:1–2:11)—it provides assurance to God’s people that God is sovereign and just, and it serves as a day of salvation for those who have listened to the prophets and turned to the Lord (see Joel 2:31-32). The same God who would bring devastation upon his enemies would be a refuge and a fortress for his people (Joel 3:11). And the nations that were used by God to bring his judgment upon Israel and Judah would later face their own day of the Lord (see, e.g., Isa 13:4-22; Ezek 30:1-5; Obad 1:15-16).\nWhile the judgment referred to by the Old Testament prophets was largely realized in the Exile, New Testament writers picked up the expression day of the Lord to speak of the return of Christ as judge of all the earth. That day will come “as unexpectedly as a thief” (2 Pet 3:10; see also 1 Thes 5:2-4), so God’s people must be prepared—or else face a similar fate to those who failed to heed the warnings of the prophets.\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 2:10-22; 4:1-6; 13:4-12; Ezek 30:1-5; Joel 1:13-15; 2:1-11, 28-32; 3:9-16; Amos 5:18-24; Obad 1:15-16; Zeph 1:2-18; Mal 4:1-5; 1 Cor 1:8; 5:5; 1 Thes 5:2; 2 Thes 2:2; 2 Tim 1:18; 2 Pet 3:10; Rev 20:1-15",

The Holy One is the King (6:5), the righteous and just one (26:7), the incomparable God (40:25), and the Redeemer of his people (41:14). Anyone coming to the Holy One must worship him in reverence and awe. The Holy One identifies himself with Mount Zion, called holy because it is his symbolic dwelling place (see 18:7; 24:23; 27:13; 56:7; 60:1-22).\nThe Holy One stands apart from all his creation because he is morally perfect. Sinful people cannot dwell with him (see 1:4). God’s holiness requires ritual purity and moral perfection. God is a consuming fire who purges away anything that does not conform to his holy will (see 33:14).\nYet the Holy One sets aside a remnant for himself (4:2-3; 6:13). He washes away their filth and commits to be present with them (12:6), his own redeemed people (35:8-9; 62:12; see also 49:7). He demonstrates his holy power as he comes to the aid of sinful and weak humans, rescues them from the exile that their sin creates, and opens up the new creation for them.\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 71:22-23; 78:41; Prov 9:10; Isa 6:1-5; 10:17, 20; 17:7; 29:17-24; 30:15; 41:14, 17-20; 43:1-4, 10-21; 48:17-18; 54:4-5; 55:5; 57:15; Jer 50:29; 51:5; Ezek 39:7-8; Hos 11:8-9; Hab 3:3-6; John 6:66-69; Acts 2:27; 13:35; Rev 16:5-7",

    "content": "God’s Justice\nGod is just (Ps 9:7-8); he detests sin and rewards people and nations justly in accordance with what they do (Ps 67:4; Isa 1:27; Jer 46:28; Joel 3:1-8; Acts 17:31). God is in sovereign control of the natural world (Nah 1:4-6, 8) and of all nations (1:3, 6-10, 15), and the world and its inhabitants stand helpless when opposing him (Job 41:10-11; Isa 40:22-24).\nThe Lord’s justice (Hebrew mishpat) is part of his divine order. A world without justice is a place where people set aside the order planned by the Creator. Since the Creator himself is just (Deut 32:4), it follows that his rule will be just and righteous. His Messiah will usher in a just world (Isa 9:7; 11:2-5; 16:5; 32:1-2), and his Spirit will transform the world into a place of justice, righteousness, and peace (32:15-17). This is good news for the oppressed, whose rights have been denied by the powerful of society (see 25:4-5).\nGod’s justice may sometimes seem slow in coming (Nah 1:3). This seemingly delayed judgment is the result of his patience and mercy toward people (Jon 3–4; 2 Pet 3:9-15). God does not execute justice with rigid disinterest; he gives justice with love and seeks to bring those who deserve judgment into a relationship with him.\nThe theme of God’s justice is notably prominent throughout the prophets, and particularly in the book of Isaiah. God expects his people to act justly toward others (Mic 6:8; Zech 7:9; Isa 1:17; 5:7; 58:6-7), and he repeately censures the people of Israel for their injustice, particularly toward the poor and needy (e.g., Amos 5:11-12; Mal 3:5; Isa 3:12-15; 5:7-8; 10:1-4; 29:21). Many of Israel’s prophets proclaim God’s judgment on his people in relation to their injustice. They also relay a number of prophecies against other oppressive, proud, unjust nations. God’s retribution for such behavior is just (see Isa 3:9-11; 13:11; 59:18).\nThe book of Nahum is specifically filled with the expression of God’s justice toward Nineveh (1:14; 2:13; 3:4). Nahum’s “good news” (Nah 1:15) is that all who trust in God will one day enjoy the peace and well-being that come with the final defeat of evil (see also Isa 11:1-9; Zeph 3:13). The ultimate fulfillment of this promise was inaugurated in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Acts 10:34-43; Rom 10:9-15). Those who believe in the Lord Jesus experience a measure of the blessings of salvation in the present as they await God’s final judgment of evil and the coming of his Kingdom in its fullness (see Rev 20:7–22:5).\nIn reality, all humanity stands condemned before the just and holy God. Yet God also provides undeserved grace. In Jesus Christ, God poured out his just judgment on a willing substitute, whose death calls people to turn away from their sin and live by God’s righteousness (Rom 6:22-23; 1 Pet 3:18). And when God’s kingdom is fully established through Christ, the world, too, will be just and righteous (Isa 1:26; 28:6; 2 Pet 3:13).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 18:17-19, 25; Exod 34:6-7; Lev 19:15; Deut 16:18-20; 17:8-13; 32:4; Pss 9:7-8; 67:4; 89:14; 119:75; Prov 21:3; Eccl 12:14; Isa 1:17-28; 5:7; 11:1-9; 16:5; 32:1-2, 16-17; 40:22-24; 61:8; Jer 46:27-28; Lam 3:25-39; Ezek 34:15-16; 36:22-36; 37:24-27; Joel 3:1-2; Amos 5:21-24; Jon 3:1–4:11; Mic 6:6-8; Nah 1:3-10; 3:4; Zech 7:9-10; Matt 5:6, 10, 20; Luke 1:74-75; Acts 10:34-43; 17:30-31; 2 Pet 3:11-14; Rev 20:11-15",

    "content": "God’s Servant\nIn Isaiah 40–66 the figure of God’s servant features prominently. The servant proclaims a new order of justice and righteousness to the world (42:3-4) and serves as God’s instrument to prepare the world for God’s coming (52:7).\nWho is the Lord’s servant? Isaiah identifies the servant with Israel (41:8; 44:1-2), who serves as God’s witness (43:10) and as a light to the Gentiles. Yet Israel could not fully complete this mission: Israel was deaf, blind, and in need of God’s forgiveness (42:19; 44:21-22). Israel failed again and again. By contrast, God’s servant is faithful and waits for the coming redemption (see 61:1-3; 62:1-5). The servant thus represents the godly in Israel. The servant is God’s faithful witness to humanity, and he stands in opposition to the idolatrous practices of paganism.\nIsaiah portrays the servant as an obedient individual who suffers. The notion of the “suffering servant” found fulfillment in one particular Israelite who was perfectly faithful and suffered on behalf of others: Jesus Christ. By his suffering, God’s blessings came to many, including other nations (see Acts 26:22-23). In union and fellowship with Christ, the apostles ministered as his servants to both Jews and Gentiles (Acts 13:47; 26:14-18). All those who have faith in Christ share in the mission of the servant and fulfill the role of God’s servants in the world (e.g., Col 1:7; 4:12; 1 Tim 4:6; 2 Tim 2:24).\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 25:42, 55; 1 Kgs 11:36; 2 Kgs 9:7; Pss 89:20-29; 113:1; Isa 41:8-10; 42:1-4, 19-20; 43:10; 44:1-5, 21-22; 49:1-7; 52:7, 13–53:12; 61:1-3; Jer 30:10; 33:20-22, 26; 46:27-28; Ezek 28:25; 34:23-24; 37:24-25; Zech 3:8; Matt 12:15-21; Acts 2:18; 2 Tim 2:24",

    "content": "The Promise of a Second Exodus\nLike the exodus from Egypt, Israel’s return from exile would restore God’s people to the land. Just as they had left Egypt many years before, the people of Israel would leave Babylon (Isa 48:20-21). This time they would have to be cleansed (52:11) and would not rush their departure (52:12).\nBoth the experience in exile and the journey are likened to a desert (see 35:1) from which the Lord would bring rescue. He prepares a road through the desert (43:19), transforms the desert into a watering hole with vegetation and animals (43:19-20), removes obstacles along the way (42:16; 49:11), guides his people through the desert (42:16; 58:11; 63:13), feeds them (49:10), protects them from the desert heat (49:10), and strengthens them (58:11). He changes the experience of the exiles from sorrow to great joy (51:3) and pours out his Spirit on them (44:3-4).\nAn exodus of sorts also occurs for all those who believe in Christ—an exodus from sin and death through Christ’s death and the power of his resurrection. The Holy Spirit enables believers to live in newness of life and to serve God with joy as they await the coming of his kingdom in all its fullness.\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 35:8-10; 42:14-16; 43:18-21; 44:3-4; 48:20-21; 49:9-12; 52:11-12; 58:8-12; Jer 31:2-17; Joel 3:17-21; Luke 1:78-79; John 7:38; 15:19; 2 Cor 5:17; 6:17-18; Eph 5:8; Col 1:13; Heb 13:12-14; Rev 7:16",

    "content": "Salvation in Isaiah\nIsaiah’s name means Yahweh is salvation. He calls on people to turn away from their many false saviors to the only true Savior and protector. Salvation involves all aspects of existence (physical, spiritual, etc.). For example, the word salvation sometimes occurs in the book of Isaiah together with righteousness to signify a harmonious order where injustice, disgrace, and mourning are absent (45:8; 51:8).\nIsaiah repeatedly relays the good news that the Lord is coming to restore his people (e.g., 4:2-6; 10:24-34; 40:9-11). Even though punishment and exile were coming because of the people’s wickedness, the Lord would not abandon his people. Rather, he would deliver them: Babylon would fall, and the anguish and humiliation of the Exile would end. Chapters 1–39 anticipate this message, while chapters 40–66 describe it clearly.\nIsaiah also points to the salvation that God would bring through Jesus Christ. He prophesies about a “Branch” that would come from the line of David who would have the Spirit and would bring justice and righteousness (11:1-5). He also speaks of God’s servant, who would suffer for the sins of the people (52:13–53:12). Jesus fulfilled these prophecies of Isaiah and brought deliverance from sin and death.\nPassages for Further Study\nPs 27:1; Isa 49:8; 59:15-21; 61:1-3; Luke 4:18-21; John 3:16-17; 12:47; Rom 10:9-13; 2 Cor 5:18-21; Titus 2:11-13; Heb 9:27-28; 1 Pet 3:18-21; Rev 7:9-10",

    "content": "The New Order\nIsaiah differentiates the old order, the present world of human powers and pressures, from the new order, a new creation where justice and harmony triumph.\nThe old order evokes memories of weeping (65:19), death (65:20), oppression and violence (65:21-22), and the absence of God (65:24). It is characterized by human power and pride.\nIsaiah’s vision of the new order centers on the Lord as the Great King in his holiness and glory (see 6:1-5). God’s people experience aspects of the new order in this life, such as God’s comfort (40:1), salvation (45:22), joy (24:14-15), righteousness (24:16), peace (26:3), divine blessing, and protection. Other dimensions lie beyond our experience: the end of death (25:7-8); the resurrection (26:19); the cessation of enmity, corruption, and evil (60:18; 65:25); the full enjoyment of God’s presence (60:19); and God’s uncontested rule in his eternal kingdom (see Rev 21–22).

    "content": "The Broken Covenant\nA central issue in the Lord’s relationship with Israel was whether the covenant made at Sinai (see Exod 20–24), which the people had broken, was still valid. In the politics of the ancient Near East, covenantal agreements were common. When one of the partners in a covenant broke the terms of the agreement, the result was usually war. The Sinai covenant was unique because the Lord was one of the covenant partners. The covenant was patterned after secular covenants—it required the Lord and Israel to seal the agreement with solemn oaths of faithfulness (Exod 24:1-11; Deut 29–30; Josh 8:30-35; 24:1-28). The Lord always remained faithful to his covenant commitment, but the Israelite people repeatedly broke the covenant as Canaanite polytheism lured them away from the Lord. They broke the laws banning the worship of idols, engaged in immoral sexual rituals, mistreated the poor and needy, and ignored God’s requirements for righteousness.\nFor centuries, the Israelites swung back and forth between worship of the Lord God and worship of Canaanite deities. Whenever they repented and returned to the Lord, he mercifully took them back into the covenant relationship. However, by the mid-700s BC, the Israelites of the northern kingdom of Israel had become stubbornly resolute in their idol worship. So the Lord let the Assyrians destroy the kingdom and take many people into captivity.\nAt the time of Jeremiah’s ministry, over one hundred years later, Judah was headed down the same road. Jeremiah likened this tragedy to the breakup of a marriage relationship, much as Hosea had pictured it earlier for Israel (Jer 2–3; cp. Hos 1–2). Israel’s bond with the Lord is portrayed as a marriage in which the bride forsook her husband and took up with other lovers. The Lord charged his people with violating the marriage bond and acting like a prostitute (Jer 3:1), and he warned them to return to him or face destruction. God could no longer say of the Israelites, “I will be their God, and they will be my people” (see Jer 31:33; see also Exod 6:7; Hos 1:9).\nJust as breaking the covenant had cost the northern kingdom its existence, so it later destroyed the kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem was torn apart, and the Temple was destroyed. This punishment cut deeply and painfully into God’s heart. The ever-merciful Lord promised a new covenant to replace the broken Sinai covenant (Jer 31:31-34).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 6:7; Jer 2:1–3:10; 4:4; 22:8-9; 31:31-34; Ezek 16:1-63; Hos 2:2-13; 3:1; 4:1–5:15",

    "content": "Basic Laws\nThroughout Scripture, the one true God is the highest authority; his laws are set out both as positive commands and as negative prohibitions. The positive side can be summed up in two basic laws: “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength” (Deut 6:5; Matt 22:37; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27), and “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Lev 19:18; Matt 19:19; Mark 12:31; Luke 10:27). These two basic laws are reflected in the positive laws in the Ten Commandments (Exod 20:2-17; Deut 5:6-21): “Observe the Sabbath day. . . . Honor your father and mother.” These commands open the door to the expression of “faith, hope, and love” (see 1 Cor 13:13).\nThe negative prohibitions set up a boundary between good and evil. Primary among these laws are the first two of the Ten Commandments: “You must not have any other god but me” (Exod 20:3), and “You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image . . . You must not bow down to them or worship them” (Exod 20:4-5). These prohibited behaviors violate the fundamental command to love the Lord.\nIn the books of the prophets, these laws lie behind God’s evaluation of the Israelites’ conduct—as well as the conduct of any ruler, group of people, or individual in any time or place. Those who violate these core laws reject the one true God, resulting in decrees of divine judgment and disastrous consequences.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 20:2-17; Lev 19:18; Deut 5:6-21; 6:5; Jer 2:7-13; 3:8-11; 5:1-9; 6:10-21; 7:16-29; 8:9-13; 11:6-14; 17:1-4; 22:1-9; 23:10-12; 34:8-20; Matt 19:19; 22:37; Mark 12:30-31; Luke 10:27; 1 Cor 13:13",

    "content": "Invasion\nIn the ancient world, invasions by foreign powers were relatively common. When they occurred, they brought great hardship; and if the invaders succeeded, what followed was staggering: destruction and suffering as the victorious invaders killed the adult men, raped the women, enslaved the children, plundered all that was valuable, and destroyed everything else. The threat of invasion brought terror.\nIn the last decades of the monarchy, the people of Judah and Jerusalem were living in the shadow of Babylon and under constant threat of hostile conquest. Over a century earlier, the Assyrians had destroyed the northern kingdom of Israel, had flooded into Judah, and had besieged Jerusalem. These events were still fresh in the memories of the people of Judah. The prophet Jeremiah warned of another impending invasion and the desolation it would bring.\nIn times when invasion threatened, it was tempting to look for anything that could prevent the suffering that was coming. Prophets like Jeremiah encouraged God’s people to turn away from false gods and back to the Lord, to stop looking to powerful allies to rescue them and instead look to the Lord for protection. The prophets sometimes also painted a vivid picture of exactly what would happen when invasion came. Their purpose was not to cause terror or to dishearten God’s people, but to turn them back to the Lord so that they would trust in him to save them and experience his rescue. This is precisely how Hezekiah had responded to the Assyrian invasion a century earlier—he turned to the Lord, and the Lord had indeed rescued him and his people.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 14:1-16; 2 Kgs 17:5-23; 18:13–19:37; Isa 6:8-13; 36:1–37:38; 65:21-23; Jer 6:22-26; 19:7-15",

    "content": "God’s Uniqueness\nAs Creator, God stands wholly apart from the things he has created. God is not part of nature; he created and rules nature. He has always existed as the living God, the intelligent Designer who decreed that the universe should function according to his laws. He gave life to all living beings. As God, he is present everywhere and knows all things. He is the living God of love, holiness, justice, and power.\nThe nations around Israel worshiped numerous gods, who were often identified with elements of the natural world. These nature deities and their images were false, lifeless, and immobile (see Jer 10:1-5). They could not communicate with people or relate to individuals. They could not even move about by their own power, because they had no power. Unfortunately, God’s people often followed the idolatrous practices of their neighbors, leading the prophets to remind the people of God’s uniqueness.\nIn contrast to lifeless idols, the one, true, living God relates to his specially made humans on a personal basis, despite his otherness. He reaches into the lives of individuals and reveals his will so that each person can understand his desires and respond to him. The Lord, who created all things, strikingly seeks an individual relationship with his people.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:1–2:4; Exod 15:11; 20:2-6; Deut 4:32-39; 33:26; Job 38:1–41:34; Pss 86:8; 115:4-7; 139:1-18; Isa 42:8; 44:9-20; Jer 10:1-16; 14:22; Amos 4:13; 5:8-9; Rev 15:3-4",

    "content": "God Protects His Servant\nWhen God called Jeremiah as his messenger, he promised to protect him. One aspect of this protection was spiritual, as the Lord gave Jeremiah the inner strength of a fortified city (Jer 1:18). God’s protection was also physical: “They will fight you, but they will fail” (1:19).\nDuring Josiah’s reign (640–609 BC), Jeremiah did not encounter much personal danger, but the situation changed dramatically when Jehoiakim came to power (609–598 BC). Hostility from the king and his officials surfaced quickly, and Jeremiah suddenly found his life in danger. But the Lord reassured him of divine protection (see 11:18-23). That promise seemed to be contradicted when Pashhur arrested Jeremiah, had him whipped, and placed him in stocks (20:1-2). Jeremiah rebuked the Lord for seemingly misleading him, but he soon regained his trust in the Lord (20:7-13). On another occasion early in Jehoiakim’s reign, Jeremiah was arrested and placed on trial (ch 26). The Lord fulfilled his promise to strengthen Jeremiah inwardly, which allowed the prophet to remain calm. Physical protection came from some elders in the community who had served under King Josiah. They reminded the group of Hezekiah’s response to danger a century before, and Ahikam saved Jeremiah’s life (26:24). Jeremiah then went into hiding when Jehoiakim’s officers sought to kill him, and the Lord allowed Jeremiah to remain hidden until after Jehoiakim’s death (36:19-20, 26).\nThe new king, Zedekiah, was kinder to Jeremiah; nonetheless, Jeremiah’s life was in danger several times during the siege of Jerusalem. At one point, the king’s officials cast him into a muddy cistern. God protected Jeremiah by prompting a foreigner, Ebed-melech, to rescue the prophet. Zedekiah then placed Jeremiah in protective custody (ch 38).\nJeremiah survived the fall of Jerusalem, though he was almost taken captive to Babylon. God prompted the Babylonian general to release Jeremiah from bondage and to give him a choice between going to Babylon as a free man and staying with Gedaliah, the newly appointed governor of Judah (39:11-14; 40:1-6). God also protected Jeremiah from Johanan and his companions, who took Jeremiah and Baruch to Egypt against their will (43:1-7).\nGod faithfully kept his promises to Jeremiah, as he still faithfully keeps his promises to all his people. He does not always promise to physically protect those who serve him (see 2 Cor 6:4-5; 2 Tim 2:10-13; 3:11-13; 1 Pet 2:21-23; 3:14-17; Rev 14:12), but he does promise eternal salvation to those who trust in him (Jas 1:12; 1 Pet 1:6-9; 4:12-19).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 20:3-7; 31:24; Num 14:10-35; 2 Kgs 6:14-20; Job 1:9-11; Ps 91:1-16; Jer 1:18-19; 11:18-23; 20:1-2, 7-13; 26:24; 36:19-20, 26; 39:11-14; Matt 2:13-22; 10:28-31; John 15:20; Acts 12:1-11; 2 Cor 6:4-5; 2 Tim 2:10-13; 3:11-13; Heb 11:4-37; Jas 1:12; 1 Pet 1:6; 3:14-17; 4:12-19; Rev 14:12",

Kings and emperors might believe that they control all events in their realms, but they are wrong. The Lord God is ultimately in control.\nThe Old Testament prophets declared that the Lord God of Israel decided who would become king or emperor of each nation. Rulers were held accountable before God concerning the morality of their policies and how they were carried out. This claim is apparent in Jeremiah 18, 25, and 46–51.\nNations that failed to recognize the reality of the one true God would suffer severe judgment. For selected nations, God softened the judgment by promising that a remnant would remain (see Jer 46–51).\nThe Lord desires every nation on earth to be converted to sincere devotion and commitment to him. He has always wanted all people to live righteous lives and to experience the joy of truly worshiping him. The book of Revelation envisions the future worship of God by people “from every nation and tribe and people and language” (Rev 7:9-10).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 8:20-22; 9:29; 2 Kgs 19:22-37; Jer 18:5-11; 25:15-29; 46:1–51:64; Dan 2:19-21; 4:34-37; Hag 2:7; Matt 28:18-20; Acts 12:21-23; Rom 13:1-7",

    "content": "The Choice of Life or Death\nIn Moses’ instructions to the Israelites when they were on the cusp of entering the Promised Land, the people were presented with a choice: Obey the covenant—life as God designed it—and live, or refuse to obey the Creator’s design and die (Deut 30:19). This choice—and its ramifications—resounded throughout God’s covenant dealings with his people.\nThe specific terminology of Deuteronomy 30 resurfaces in Jeremiah, in the context of the Babylonian invasion: “Take your choice of life or death” (Jer 21:8). The prophet warned King Zedekiah and his people to submit to the Lord’s instruction. If they did, they would live; if not, they would die. Earlier in Jeremiah’s ministry, the Lord confronted the people of Judah with an opportunity to change and come home to him (3:12–4:4). If they rejected idol worship, admitted their guilt, and confessed that they were rebels, God would cleanse their minds and hearts, and they could live peacefully in the land. However, the people scornfully rejected this offer again and again (7:5-7; 18:8-11; 23:22; 26:13; 27:12-13; 29:32; 35:15; 36:3-7; 44:5). So the Lord repeatedly warned them that if they rejected the path of life, they would experience judgment.\nIn Jeremiah’s day, only a few chose life; the majority rebelled and experienced death. In the end, the people led by Zedekiah ignored the Lord, defied the Babylonian army, and indeed suffered judgment. They intentionally rejected the gift of life.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 11:26-29; 30:15-20; Prov 9:1-18; 11:19; 18:21; Isa 1:19-20; Jer 3:12-15; 4:3-4; 7:5-7; 18:7-11; 21:8-9; 23:22; 26:13; 27:12-18; 35:15; 36:3-7; 44:5; Ezek 18:23-24; Rom 6:23; 8:6; Rev 2:10",

    "content": "The Collapse of Culture\nImpressive cultures full of creative and skilled people sometimes fall apart suddenly and completely. While digging, archaeologists often find a layer of ash between strata of remarkable artifacts; the ash indicates the destruction of the culture. This is one of the most disturbing aspects of human history.\nIsrael’s history is replete with cycles of courage and success followed by disaster. People of God led Israel into new periods of power (Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon), but the nation repeatedly fell into worshiping deities other than the one true God. Repeatedly, God’s people fell under judgment as their culture disintegrated and their political independence was replaced with servitude and oppression. The northern kingdom of Israel was especially captivated by the idol-worship of Baal and Asherah. As a result, the Lord turned the northern kingdom over to the Assyrians, who demolished it in 722 BC.\nIn Jeremiah’s time, the collapse of spiritual and political culture was occurring in the southern kingdom of Judah. Some of the nation’s kings, including Josiah, faithfully followed the covenant ban on idol worship and led the people of Judah back to the Lord. However, many other rulers, including Josiah’s sons, did not carry on such reforms. For example, Jehoiakim had no interest in continuing his father’s revival of devotion to the Lord, seeing it as an impediment to his own political power. He was so hardened toward the Lord that he tried to kill Jeremiah, the Lord’s messenger. Zedekiah was more fearful than hardened, but he also refused to return to the Lord.\nThe Lord’s messages through Jeremiah contain strong indictments of Judah’s devotion to Baal (2:8; 7:9; 11:13, 17; 12:16; 19:5; 23:13, 27; 32:29, 35) and condemn the immorality that accompanied this idolatry. Judah’s moral depravity and spiritual rottenness—exemplified by its greed, hate, and violence—were exposed for all to see. Despite their stubborn refusal to turn away from idol worship and back to worship of the one true God, the people of Judah hoped that the Lord would work a miracle by defeating the Babylonian army and sending it back home. They thought that the Temple would magically protect them, not understanding that God was disgusted over what they were doing there, which was speeding their destruction rather than protecting them (7:4-15). They were totally unprepared to face the horror of defeat in war and the destruction of their nation, their capital, and their Temple. They were unaware that their spiritual and moral collapse had already made their doom certain.\nPassages for Further Study\nJosh 1:1-9; 11:16-23; 1 Sam 4:1-22; 2 Kgs 17:6-18; 23:1–25:30; Jer 7:4-15; 19:1-7; 24:1-10; 28:10-17; Dan 7:1–8:27",

A positive response would open a bright future for the people. They could know the salvation that heals hearts (3:22-23), and Israel would become a blessing to all nations (4:1-2). The people’s repentance would bring God’s anger to an end, and the nation would not be destroyed. Even in times of crisis before the fall of Jerusalem, promises of a wonderful future offered hope for the nation (see 16:15; 23:3-8; 29:10-14; 30:1–33:26).\nEven after the fall of Jerusalem, the Lord again offered hope to the exiles in Babylon. After seventy years, the exiles who turned to the Lord would return to the Promised Land to rebuild the Temple and the city of Jerusalem. A functioning community would know peace and prosperity (see 46:27-28; chs 50–51). Babylon would be conquered, and the exiles would return to Judah. These events occurred in 539–538 BC.\nHope for the people of God extended well into the future, as God promised a righteous descendant of King David who would rule over his people (Isa 11:1-5; Jer 23:5-6; 33:15-17). Jesus Christ is that righteous descendant; through his death on the cross, he became the mediator of a new covenant (Heb 9:13-15; 12:22-24). Those who trust in him now hope for his eternal kingdom beyond God’s judgments in the present age.\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 2:3-4; 4:2; 11:1-16; 35:1-10; 52:11-12; Jer 3:11–4:2; 16:14-15; 23:3-8; 29:10-14; 30:1–33:26; 46:27; Hos 3:4-5; Amos 9:11-15; Heb 9:13-15; 12:22-24",

    "content": "The New Covenant\nThe key affirmation of the Sinai covenant was, “I will claim you as my own people, and I will be your God” (Exod 6:7; see Jer 31:33). The relationship between God and his people envisioned in the Sinai covenant was surrounded by laws chiseled in stone and a priestly class in charge of all religious institutions and activities.\nThe new covenant would differ from the old in one primary way: It would no longer be external to the worshipers, but would now be written on their hearts (Jer 31:33). The great liability of the old covenant was that it lacked the power to enable people to do what it commanded (see Rom 8:3). The new covenant would be internalized through the power of the Holy Spirit (Ezek 36:24-27). Thus, it would become possible for people everywhere (not just a select few) to fulfill God’s covenant plan for life as summed up in the two “Great Commandments” (Matt 22:35-40): “You must love the Lord your God” (Deut 6:5) and “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Lev 19:18). The new covenant would achieve the goal that the old one pointed to but could not reach: creating new persons and a new community. The goal is a deep transformation of sinners, beginning with forgiveness of sins and culminating in a holiness exemplified by good works (Eph 1:4; 2:8-10).\nJeremiah 30–33 stands out in its optimistic view of Israel’s future. The high point of this section (31:31-34) is the announcement that the Lord God will form a new covenant with his people. This passage in Jeremiah points toward Jesus of Nazareth, whose death would seal this new covenant. Jesus applied the new covenant to himself when he instituted the communion ritual (Matt 26:28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20; see also 1 Cor 11:25; 2 Cor 3:6). Jesus’ death made him the mediator of the covenant for whoever believes in him (Heb 8:8-12; ch 9). Christians commemorate that reality each time they participate in Communion. According to the New Testament, all believers in Jesus Christ will know him directly by the activity of the Holy Spirit, whose indwelling has been made possible through the sacrifice of Christ. They will know him personally and experience him powerfully, as only a few did in Old Testament times.\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 11:1-9; 54:13-15; Jer 31:31-34; Ezek 37:24-28; Matt 26:27-28; Luke 22:20; Rom 11:25-36; 1 Cor 11:23-26; 2 Cor 3:6-18; Heb 8:8–9:28",

    "content": "The Written Word\nWhen Jeremiah’s ministry was in crisis during his public trial on the Temple grounds (Jer 26), some friends saved his life, but King Jehoiakim had the prophet Uriah killed and tried to arrest Jeremiah. Would this signal the end of Jeremiah’s public ministry? Was public speaking the only way to get the Lord’s messages to the leaders and people of Judah?\nAs it turns out, killing and silencing the messengers did not stop the Lord’s messages—the Lord’s word could be broadcast effectively in writing. The Lord told Jeremiah to write down all the messages he had ever delivered (Jer 36). Jeremiah had a helper, Baruch, who was skilled in writing and making as many copies as were needed. While Jeremiah and Baruch were in hiding, they purchased a scroll (a roll of papyrus) and prepared it so as to record the written messages. When the writing was finished, the scroll was read in the Temple courtyard and in the presence of King Jehoiakim. The king cut up the scroll and burned it, but Jeremiah had the messages rewritten on a new scroll, adding new material. Throughout the remainder of Jeremiah’s ministry, he had his messages written on papyrus and sent to the leaders of various countries, as well as to the exiles in Babylon (see Jer 29).\nThe earliest example of writing the word of God appears in Exodus, where Moses was commanded to write down the words of the covenant (Exod 24:4, but see also Exod 17:14). It is specifically stated that Moses wrote the book of Deuteronomy (Deut 31:9, 24). The existence of the written book of the Law probably stimulated a tradition of writing down certain elements of what God was revealing (Josh 24:26; 1 Sam 10:25; 1 Chr 29:29; 2 Chr 9:29; Isa 8:16-17; 30:8). Many of Israel’s historical writings are said to have been kept by prophets (see 2 Chr 12:15; 13:22).\nThese written documents, especially those written on leather scrolls, were kept in communities for a long time, and many copies were made from one document. These copies were so valuable that they were carefully preserved for centuries. The copies were also translated into any number of languages. The book of Jeremiah and the writings of other prophets, wise men, and teachers have been preserved, collected, and handed down to us as the Old and New Testaments, giving us a written record of God’s messages to his people (see 2 Tim 3:16-17; 2 Pet 1:20-21).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 17:14; 31:18; 34:27-28; Deut 31:9-13; Isa 30:8; Jer 30:2-3; Jer 36:1-32; 45:1; 51:60-64; Ezek 43:11; Dan 7:1; Luke 1:1-4; John 5:46-47; 20:30-31; 21:24-25; Acts 1:1-2; Rom 15:4; 1 Cor 10:11; 2 Tim 3:16-17; Phlm 1:21; Heb 13:22; 1 Pet 5:12; 2 Pet 1:20-21; 1 Jn 1:4; 2:12-24; 5:13; Rev 1:11; 10:4; 21:5; 22:18-19",

    "content": "God’s Glory with His People\nIn ancient Israel, God’s glory was particularly manifest at the central sanctuaries that had been built for him. When the Israelites completed construction of the Tabernacle, that sacred space became filled with the glory of the Lord (Exod 40:34-35). Likewise, after the Temple was completed and the Ark of the Covenant was brought in, God’s glorious presence filled the Temple (1 Kgs 8:10-11).\nThe presence and absence of God’s glory is a central theme in the book of Ezekiel. God’s glory appears to the prophet Ezekiel while he is exiled in Babylon, meaning that his glory was no longer present at the Temple in Jerusalem. The reason God’s glory had departed from the Temple at that time becomes clear in Ezekiel’s vision in Ezekiel 8–11, in which the prophet sees the abominations that had polluted the Temple in Jerusalem. Without God’s presence, the Temple had become an empty shell awaiting destruction. God was not forcibly evicted by the superior might of the Babylonian army; he voluntarily departed because his people were defiled. Their sin drove him away from the land he had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For a time, the Lord went from Jerusalem to Babylon to become a sanctuary for the exiles there (see 11:16).\nGod would not abandon his Temple forever. After pouring out his wrath in full measure, he would restore a remnant to their land and sanctify them by his Spirit so that he could once again dwell in their midst in a new sanctuary (37:26). God’s glory, dwelling among his people forever (43:1-5), is at the heart of Ezekiel’s vision of their restoration.\nThe glory of God has come to live among us fully in the person of Jesus Christ. As John testifies, “We have seen his glory, the glory of the Father’s one and only Son” (John 1:14). The aged Simeon saw the baby Jesus brought to the Temple and described him as “a light to reveal God to the nations, and . . . the glory of your people Israel” (Luke 2:32). Jesus’ glory was veiled while he was on earth, though for a moment on the Mount of Transfiguration his radiance was revealed to his closest disciples (Matt 17:2). He experienced his own abandonment by God as he hung on the cross, bearing the curse for our sin (Matt 27:46). Now, as the exalted and glorified Lord, he sits at God’s right hand (Eph 1:19-20). By his Spirit, he has promised never to abandon us, but to be with us to the end of time (Matt 28:20).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 15:11; 33:18–34:8; 40:34; Ps 19:1-11; Isa 4:5-6; 6:3; 40:5; 42:8; 43:7; 58:8; 60:1-2; Ezek 1:1-28; 11:16; 37:26; 43:1-5; 44:4; Hab 2:14; Matt 17:2; 28:20; Luke 2:32; John 1:14; 2 Cor 4:4-6; Heb 1:3; Rev 21:10-11, 23",

    "content": "Prophetic Sign Acts\nThe prophets of Israel occasionally communicated through sign acts, which were dramatic visual aids performed in public to increase the impact of the message and help people feel the truth as much as hear it. Their purpose was to present an unforgettable message. These acts were unusual, even outlandish—and not just from a modern perspective. Unlike modern readers, however (who might think that the prophet was psychologically disturbed), ancient observers understood these sign acts as a regular part of a prophet’s communication style.\nEzekiel was required to act out his message more frequently than any other prophet, perhaps because he was communicating to a particularly hardened audience (Ezek 2:6-7). The sign acts reinforced the content of his message and underlined the depth of his personal commitment to it. For example, after he swallowed the word of God (2:8–3:3), Ezekiel embodied it for the exiles (3:4-9) in a series of judgment scenes (chs 4–6). This dramatic form of communication is difficult for even a hostile audience to ignore or forget.\nThe ultimate sign act was performed by Jesus Christ on the cross (see Matt 27:32-54). There God visibly depicted his wrath against sin in the darkness, the earthquake, and the agony of the sinless one who was apparently abandoned by his Father. God also depicted his profound love for the world in that he would rather die than let his people go. The cross is a confrontational message of God’s love and wrath that is hard to ignore or forget.\nPassages for Further Study\nJer 13:1-11; 19:1-15; 25:15; Ezek 2:6–3:3; 3:4-9; 4:1-17; 5:1–6:14; 12:1-28; 21:19-23; 24:1-14, 16-27; 37:15-28; Hos 1:2-9; 3:1-3; Matt 26:26-28; 27:45-54; Mark 6:11; 11:12-21; Luke 22:17-20; Rom 6:3-5; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 11:23-32",

    "content": "False Prophets\nThe Bible tells of many individuals who set themselves up as prophets on their own authority. They had no true calling from God but nonetheless claimed to speak for him. Often it was hard for people to discern the difference between true and false prophets, especially since false prophets usually told them what they wanted to hear (see, e.g., 1 Kgs 22:10-14; Jer 28:1-4).\nBecause of this difficulty, and the Lord’s merciful delay in bringing judgment upon his rebellious people, many people doubted that God’s word through his true prophets would ever be fulfilled (see Isa 5:19). Others denied that anything would happen within their lifetimes. Might not the punishment that had so often been delayed be delayed a little longer?\nEzekiel prophesied that in the coming judgment upon Jerusalem, false prophets would be cut off so that people would no longer be confused about who the true prophets were (Ezek 13:8-9). There would also be no more delay to God’s judgment—the Lord was coming very soon to fulfill the words he had spoken (13:11). Everyone would see which words God had really spoken and which words the false prophets had conjured out of their own imaginations.\nJesus warned of the presence of false prophets in the future (Matt 24:11-28), and his early followers encountered numerous false prophets (see, e.g., Acts 13:6-12; 2 Pet 2:1-3). Believers can often recognize false prophets by their incorrect teaching about Christ, which demonstrates that they are not operating under the Spirit of God (1 Jn 4:1-3).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 13:1-5; 18:22; 1 Kgs 22:8-28; Jer 6:13-15; 14:13-16; 20:1-6; 28:1-17; 29:21-32; 50:6; Ezek 13:1-23; 22:28; Mic 3:5; 2 Cor 11:13-15; 2 Tim 4:3-4; 2 Pet 2:1-3",

    "content": "Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility\nThe Bible ultimately traces all things back to God’s sovereignty. For example, the fact that the rain falls on the just and unjust alike is part of God’s sovereign plan (Matt 5:45).\nAt the same time, God is in no way responsible for our sin; it is our responsibility because it comes from our own sinful desires. Scripture repeatedly demonstrates that people have the ability to choose to follow God or to reject him (see, e.g., Deut 30:15-20; Josh 24:15; John 1:12; Rom 10:9-13). God does not coerce people to have faith in him.\nEzekiel 14:9-11 describes an intriguing situation in which God deceives a prophet but then also holds that same prophet accountable for his actions. This leads to a difficult question: How can we reconcile God’s sovereign control over all things with the personal choices and decisions for which we will be called to account?\nIn giving misleading messages to false prophets, God was simply giving them and their hearers exactly what they wanted (cp. 2 Thes 2:11). Even a false prophet could give a prophecy that led people astray only with the Lord’s permission or direction. Unless God restrained them from their sin, they would choose lies instead of the truth and worship creation in place of the Creator (Rom 1:18-25). God simply gave them permission to enact their hearts’ sinful desires.\nThe remarkable fact is not that God allows some sinners to persist in their chosen delusions, but that he saves sinners, changes our natures, and gives us the desire to do good for his glory (see Ezek 36:25-26; Rom 8:1-11; Eph 2:10). While we may not be able to completely reconcile this complex tension, we can be assured of the freely offered grace of God and the new life that he gives through his Spirit to all who trust in him.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 2:6-7; 1 Kgs 22:19-22; 2 Chr 20:6; Job 1:8-12; 2:2-6; Pss 115:3; 135:6-14; Isa 45:6-7; Lam 3:37-40; Ezek 14:9-11; 17:24; 36:25-26; Dan 2:20-22; Amos 3:6; 4:6-11; Rom 1:18-25; 9:8-33; 12:2; Eph 4:20-24; 2 Thes 2:11-12; Heb 13:20-21; Jas 1:13-14; 4:12-16",

    "content": "Messages against the Nations\nWhy would Israel’s prophets address discourses to nations who in all likelihood would never hear the messages uttered against them? Why were the prophets concerned about what these nations thought and did?\nIt was because the real audience was the people of God. These messages reminded God’s people that God does not operate on a double standard, judging the sins of his own people while the nations around them were free to act as they wished. Though judgment begins with God’s own household (1 Pet 4:17), it certainly does not end there. God will judge all, both inside and outside Israel, who rebel against him and his reign. All must come to acknowledge the Lord as the one true and sovereign God.\nThe people of Judah were inclined to trust some of these nations (such as Egypt) to rescue them from foreign oppressors—not realizing that God was using other nations to bring judgment upon his people. The prophets reminded the people that no nation on earth can be trusted in place of God. In the end, all nations will bow before him.\nThe messages against the foreign nations also reminded the covenant community that in spite of God’s judgment on them because of their sin, they were still his precious people. The primary accusation against these foreign nations was that they had persecuted and insulted God’s chosen people and had thereby affronted God. The negative side of God’s covenant with Abraham was still in force: “I will . . . curse those who treat you with contempt” (Gen 12:3).\nGod’s consistent purpose in history is to bring glory to himself. By exiling his sinful people and by judging their arrogant oppressors, God displayed his power and holiness. Yet, in spite of the Exile, there was still hope for the positive side of the covenant to be fulfilled: “All the families on earth will be blessed through you” (Gen 12:3; see also Rom 11:1-27). God’s purposes for his people were not exhausted; he would ultimately bring glory to himself by bringing them back from the distant lands to which they had been scattered.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:3; Deut 23:3-6; Isa 13:1–23:18; Jer 25:29; 46:1–51:64; Ezek 9:6; 25:1–32:32; 36:23; 39:7; Dan 4:17; Amos 1:1–2:3; 3:2; Obad 1:1-16; John 15:18-24; Acts 3:25-26; Rom 2:9-10; 11:1-27; Eph 1:3-14; 1 Pet 4:17; Rev 18:1-24",

    "content": "The Promise of New Life\nThe Resurrection is a core tenet of Christian faith—without it, our faith is useless (1 Cor 15:14). God has promised that we share this resurrection with Christ (Col 3:1), and it is important to rightly understand exactly what new life God promises to us.\nEzekiel 37 might at first appear to teach that all people will be resurrected from the dead, living again in new bodies after their present bodies die. However, Ezekiel is not dealing with the general question, “Can human bones return to life?” Ezekiel and his audience were already familiar with the possibility of dead people being raised to life because of their knowledge of the miracles of Elijah and Elisha (1 Kgs 17:17-24; 2 Kgs 4:31-37; 13:20-21). Instead, Ezekiel is addressing the particular question, “Can these bones live?” That is, could the nation of Judah—a denuded, dismembered, and desiccated nation—be restored?\nAt that time, the Babylonians had devastated Judah, the Temple had been destroyed, and many of the people had been exiled to Babylon. The people still in Judah were a mere remnant, only the poorest of the poor (see 2 Kgs 25:8-12). Many concluded that there was no future for God’s people. They said, “We have become old, dry bones—all hope is gone. Our nation is finished” (Ezek 37:11). The question was not whether God could raise them to new life, but whether he would perform such a miracle for the dry bones that represented Israel.\nThe prophet answered this question with a resounding Yes! God would return his people to life through an outpouring of his Spirit in response to the prophet’s word. Their death because of their sins was real, but God would not leave them in the grave (cp. Ps 16:10). Rather, he promised that in the future he would give his people life by his Spirit and would transform them into a new creation, a new Spirit-filled Israel. This new people of God would be raised to their feet as a mighty army that would serve the Lord.\nGod is capable of raising to life both those who are physically dead and those who are spiritually dead. He chooses to give the miracle of new birth to undeserving sinners (see John 3:5-7; Eph 2:1-7). Those who experience the death of sin in their lives also experience the new life that God offers through his Spirit—both now and in eternity (see Rom 8:5-13; Col 3:1-11). He makes people whom the world would write off as irredeemable acceptable to himself in Christ (1 Cor 6:9-11), and he equips them for fruitful work in his service (Eph 4:12-13; 6:11-18).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 17:17-24; 2 Kgs 4:31-37; 13:20-21; Ps 16:10; Ezek 18:31; 37:1-28; 39:29; Matt 22:31-32; Rom 8:11; 2 Cor 5:17",

    "content": "Apocalyptic Literature\nSeveral Old Testament passages (Isa 24–27; Ezek 38:1–39:29; Dan 7–12; Zech 9–14) have elements that are similar to later Jewish apocalyptic literature. The entire book of Revelation in the New Testament also fits into this literary genre. Apocalyptic literature focuses on visions as the means of communication (the term apocalyptic comes from the Greek term apokalupsis, meaning “revelation”). Other types of prophetic literature, by contrast, put the central focus on the words of the message. To put it in courtroom terms, whereas the prophet delivering an oracle is like the prosecuting counsel, the writer of apocalyptic literature is acting as a witness, describing the heavenly realities that he has seen.\nAnother difference is that prophecy normally looks forward to salvation or judgment within the boundaries of this present world. Apocalyptic literature, by contrast, looks for a fulfillment that transcends space and time. It does not hold out hope for a gradual improvement in society; rather, it foresees a cosmic event that will bring existing realities to an end and replace them with a new reality. Apocalyptic literature has a negative view of the present time, which is often described as a time of conflict between light and darkness. There can be neither compromise nor peaceful coexistence between the supernatural forces of good and the forces of darkness and rebellion. Apocalyptic literature opens the door on the normally unseen elements of this battle between light and darkness. The reality and presence of spiritual darkness becomes particularly evident, but so do the unseen forces of good all around us, which will ultimately triumph. This future triumph is seen as fixed and certain, no matter what human or spiritual forces attempt to frustrate it.\nApocalyptic visions have a consistent purpose, which is to encourage and exhort the faithful, particularly in times of tribulation. The good news of apocalyptic literature is that even though the present looks bleak, the outcome of the decisive battle has already been determined, and the forces of light will have the ultimate victory. Apocalyptic literature acts as a corrective to pagan propaganda, which proclaims that the status quo will continue unchanged and unchallenged, and it responds with a proclamation of its own: God reigns, and his Kingdom will ultimately triumph. This news encourages the faithful during the present times of suffering and difficulty but also exhorts them to continue being faithful, no matter what the opposition. It proclaims a theology of hope to the marginalized: God is on the throne and he will ultimately triumph. In the meantime, whatever the cost in terms of suffering, obedience is the only way to live while we look forward with hope to our final vindication, when God will act decisively to bring in his new age of salvation.\nPassages for Further Study\nEzek 38:1–39:24; Daniel 7:1–12:13; Zech 9:1–14:21",

    "content": "Temple Architecture as Theology\nThe Temple plan given in Ezekiel 40–43 does not seem physically buildable, nor was it intended to be. The details given in the plan are not sufficient to guide construction, as can be seen from the varying diagrams created by scholars. The materials to be used are not specified, as they were in great detail for the Tabernacle (Exod 25:10–40:33). Neither is there evidence that any attempt was made later to build the Second Temple according to this plan. Thus, Ezekiel’s plan for the Temple is evidently not a blueprint for future construction.\nInstead, Ezekiel’s Temple vision is a theological statement in the form of an architectural plan. The vision’s message is intended to shame Ezekiel’s generation for their past and motivate them to be faithful in the future (Ezek 43:10-12). The vision describes a new world in which boundaries between the holy and the unholy are established and standards are raised, so that God may return to his Temple to dwell among his people once again (see 10:3-4, 18; 11:22-23). Access to the realm of the holy is considerably restricted. Those who were faithful in the past are granted renewed access, while those who had been unfaithful are marginalized. There is a deepened interest in the sacrifices of atonement and purification for the people.\nThis grand, new Temple points to Jesus Christ, in whom God’s glory is revealed. His body was a temple that was to be torn down and then built back up in three days (John 2:19). In Jesus, the light of God’s holiness shone out clearly in the darkness, and the darkness was not able to extinguish it (John 1:5). His body was the perfect, once-for-all sacrifice that purified the people (Heb 10:12). Those who are in Christ now have the privilege of access through him to the heavenly Most Holy Place in the new Jerusalem. Its doors stand permanently open to those who have washed their robes and made them clean in the blood of the Lamb (see Rev 21; 22:14).\nSince we have been united to Christ and have become part of his body, the new temple, how can we live any longer as we once did? The Holy Spirit dwells in us, and our bodies no longer belong to ourselves but to him as parts of his new temple (1 Cor 6:15-20). A holy life is the mark of God’s children (1 Pet 1:13-16).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 25:10–40:33; Lev 10:9-11; Ezek 22:26; 40:1–43:27; John 2:19; 1 Cor 6:15-20; Heb 9:22–10:19; 1 Pet 1:13-16; Rev 21:1-27",

    "content": "Temple Legislation as Theology\nThe rabbis of Judaism spent a great deal of time seeking to harmonize the laws of Ezekiel 44–48 with the laws of the Torah. They were unsuccessful because the legislation in these chapters was no more intended to match that of Moses than the vision of the Temple building (Ezek 40–43) was designed to match the design of the Tabernacle or the Temple of Solomon. The description of the Temple regulations conveys a theological message of change, as did the earlier description of the Temple’s architecture.\nThese regulations highlighted the need for proper separation between the Temple and the palace. The sacrificial rituals would become more numerous and more focused on purification. Holy offerings would once again be made by holy people to the holy God. These practices were completely devoted to the separation of the holy from the unholy and to the cleansing of God’s people. Since defilement of the Temple and idolatrous worship had driven the Lord out of his house (Ezek 8–11), an entirely new situation was necessary if God was to dwell once more among his people. Thus, the function of this legislation was to convict the prophet’s hearers of their past abuses that had broken down the wall of separation between the holy and the unholy and to reassure them that God would restore his people’s worship to its proper state.\nThis legislation also puts the prince, the king descended from David, in a proper place of submission to the Lord. This element finds fulfillment with the coming of Christ. Jesus came as a servant King who delighted to do the Father’s will (Matt 4:1-11; 20:25-28). He offered the perfect purification offering, cleansed the heavenly sanctuary once for all time (Heb 9:11-12, 23), and ensured that God could dwell in the midst of his people forever. His blood cleanses us of all sin and enables sinners to boldly enter the heavenly Most Holy Place without fear of rejection or reprisal.\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 56:7; Ezek 8:1–11:25; 40:1–43:27; 44:1–46:18",

    "content": "Israel’s Geography as Theology\nThe division of the land in Ezekiel 47:13–48:35 combines spiritual ideals with a practical message that reinforces themes from earlier sections of the vision (Ezek 40–46). The prophet Ezekiel saw a future with strong links to the past, for the land of Israel was still the special land that had been promised to the patriarchs.\nThe map in this vision does not resemble the earlier tribal patchwork established in Joshua’s time. In Ezekiel’s vision, each tribe would receive an equal portion of the land, arranged in east-to-west strips that oriented the whole land on the same axis as the Temple at its center. These strips of land bear no connection to the actual geographic features of the land—they are not intended to be understood physically. The point seems to be that the old tribal jealousies and hatreds will be gone, as each tribe is on exactly the same footing as the others.\nThe monarchy is not abolished in this vision, but it is transformed. The defiled city that was destroyed in the earlier chapters of Ezekiel gives way to a new holy city of unity and harmony for the tribes. A life-giving river does its work of restoration, bringing the blessing that flows from God’s Temple to bear on every aspect of the people’s lives.\nThe whole vision of Ezekiel 40–48 encourages the prophet’s hearers to repent of their past sins, to be faithful in the often-difficult present, and to hope for a brighter future through God’s power and grace. The closing chapters of the book of Revelation present this vision as fulfilled in Christ (Rev 21–22). Jesus inaugurated the spiritual reality that Ezekiel described—a heavenly city “designed and built by God” (Heb 11:10).\nPassages for Further Study\nEzek 40:1–46:24; 47:13–48:35; Rev 22:1-2",

    "content": "Four World Empires\nTwo panoramic visions in Daniel present God’s sovereignty over history. Nebuchadnezzar had the first vision (ch 2), and Daniel had another like it (ch 7). In each of these visions, four of the kingdoms of the world are presented.\nThere have always been questions about the identities of the four empires, but historically there has also been considerable consensus. Hippolytus (AD 170–236), one of the early church fathers, identified the four kingdoms as Babylonia, Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome. The church father and historian Eusebius of Caesarea (AD 260–340) initially identified the first kingdom as Assyria (which once also controlled Babylon), but he later agreed with Hippolytus, as did most of the church fathers. Later, Jerome and Augustine accepted this same understanding, and conservative interpreters largely still agree.\nIn antiquity and in our era, some interpreters have argued that Greece is the fourth empire, treating Media and Persia as separate kingdoms. This interpretation is due in part to denying the possibility of prediction, assuming the book was written before the Roman Empire had arisen. But Media and Persia are usually regarded as one empire, and the Median kingdom had been mostly assimilated by the Persians by the time Cyrus II conquered Babylon in 539 BC.\nRome is then seen as the fourth kingdom, but the bestial, demonic, and inhumane characteristics of the vision extend beyond the historical Rome. The visions also represent a panorama of the whole world and its governments; all will be destroyed and replaced by the Kingdom of God, the “rock . . . cut from a mountain” (2:34). The metals of the statue become progressively less valuable in chapter 2, while the animal imagery of chapter 7 becomes more menacingly fierce, violent, and inhumane. These features represent a deterioration of human civilization across the centuries, even as the Kingdom of God grows in power and stature (2:35).\nPassages for Further Study\nDan 2:1-49; 7:1-28",

    "content": "The Little Horn\nThe little horn in Daniel’s vision stands for a king; it has personal features such as human eyes and a mouth. This imagery is characteristic of apocalyptic literature. The little horn captures Daniel’s attention because of its “boastful speech” and its violent actions against other kings, God’s people, and the Most High.\nWhat or who is the little horn? The little horn of Daniel 7:8 is closely tied to the figures of evil in 9:27 and 11:40-45. Antiochus IV Epiphanes (8:9-14, 23-25; 11:21-39) has characteristics similar to the little horn of 7:8, but they do not appear to be identical. Ancient and modern interpreters have held that the little horn is the Antichrist to come. Some maintain that certain historical persons of the Greek and Roman empires have preliminarily fulfilled the vision (e.g., Antiochus IV Epiphanes, Nero, Caligula, Domitian). According to this view, this being yet to come will be a man, not a demon or Satan.\nIt is also helpful to see the little horn as representing the embodiment of evil that is directed against God and his people. Some interpreters believe that no single man will fulfill this vision, but that the vision represents the evil forces at work in the world. Others hold that the Antichrist has already come. The idea of the Antichrist does seem to have an ultimate fulfillment, as suggested by the New Testament (see 2 Thes 2:3-12; 1 John 2:18; 4:3; 2 Jn 1:7; Rev 13:1, 5; 16:13-14; 17:11; 19:20-21; 20:10).\nRegardless, this little horn reminds God’s people that evil violently opposes God and his people. The king described here usurps the kingdoms of this world (Dan 7:8), but his demonic system will not prevail because evil will be destroyed. God’s people can take comfort in knowing that this onslaught and manifestation of evil will be short lived (Rev 12:12) and the works of this hellish kingdom will be demolished (Dan 7:11-12). God’s chosen leader, the one “like a son of man” installed by the Ancient One (7:13-14), will rule by God’s divine approval and power, and his reign will prevail in an indestructible kingdom. God’s people are encouraged to endure and be faithful. They live in hope of a righteous kingdom in which God will live among his people (see Rev 21:3). “The passionate commitment of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will make this happen!” (Isa 9:7).\nPassages for Further Study\nDan 7:8, 11, 20-21, 24-26; 8:9-12; 9:26-27; Mark 13:14; 2 Thes 2:5-12; 2 Jn 1:7; Rev 13:1-10; 20:10",

    "content": "The Seventy Sets of Seven\nThe seventy sevens (or weeks) of Daniel 9:24-27 have always puzzled students of the Bible. Although difficult to assign to a precise period of history, the seventy sets of seven are significant: They demonstrate God’s sovereignty over history and emphasize his ability to bring his plans for his people to completion. The number seventy (seven times ten) represents completeness. For example, the seventy years of exile for God’s people (9:2) were enough to chastise them. The two main interpretations of the seventy sets of seven are presented here.\nSCENARIO A: THE REIGN OF ANTIOCHUS IV (175–163 BC).)  The seventy sets of seven refer to history from Cyrus II of Persia (539 BC; see 9:25; Ezra 1:2-4) to Antiochus IV (175–163 BC; see Dan 8:23-25; 11:21-39). In this scenario, the “Anointed One” was the high priest Onias III, and the “ruler” (9:26-27) was Antiochus IV, whose treaty with the people of Judea in 174 BC was supposed to allow them to practice their faith peacefully. In 170 BC, Antiochus attacked Jerusalem, killed many, and looted the Temple. Then in 167 BC he put an end to the sacrifices and offerings, forced the Jews to stop practicing their faith on pain of death, and desecrated the Temple with a “sacrilegious object”: He placed a statue of Zeus on the altar of burnt offering, where he sacrificed pigs and other unclean animals (cp. 11:21-35). Antiochus was struck with a painful disease, and he died in 163 BC—“The fate decreed for this defiler” was “finally poured out on him” (9:27; see also 8:25; 1 Maccabees 1:10-24; 6:7-16; 2 Maccabees 9:1-29). In Scenario A, when Jesus spoke of the “sacrilegious object that causes desecration,” he was referring to the Jews’ experience in the time of Antiochus as a paradigm of the things that would happen in the future (see Matt 24:15; cp. Luke 21:20; 2 Thes 2:3-4).\nSCENARIO B: THE DEATH OF CHRIST (AD 30 or 33).  The seventy weeks are a prophecy concerning Jesus Christ, the anointed Messiah. In this scenario, the “seventy sets of seven” began either with the decree of Cyrus (538 BC; Ezra 1:1-4) or with one of the decrees of Artaxerxes (458 or 445 BC; Ezra 7:8-26; Neh 2:1-10). The death of Christ then occurred either at the end of sixty-nine sets of seven (seven plus sixty-two, Dan 9:25-26) or at the midpoint of the seventieth (9:27). These two options have implications for how the seventy sets of seven are brought to completion. In the first option, the seventieth set of seven is seen as a future time not yet fulfilled. In the second option, the seventieth set of seven is seen as having been completed when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in AD 70. If the decree of Cyrus is seen as the starting point, the 490 years are symbolic. However, if the decree given to Nehemiah to rebuild the city (445 BC; Neh 2:1) is taken as the starting point (Dan 9:25), then there were very nearly 483 years (69 x 7 years) between that date and the death of Christ in AD 30 or 33.\nOption 1: The Seventieth Set of Seven Remains to Be Fulfilled in the Future.  Many interpreters have argued that Christ’s death occurred at the end of the sixty-ninth set of seven, and the seventieth set of seven is yet to be fulfilled. In that case, there is now a long gap from the sixty-ninth set of seven to the seventieth. The seventieth still lies in the future and corresponds to the reign of the Antichrist during the tribulation at the end of history (see 2 Thes 2:3-12; 1 Jn 2:18-22; 4:3; 2 Jn 1:7; Rev 13:1, 5; 16:13-14; 17:11; 19:20-21; 20:10).\nOption 2: The Seventieth Set of Seven Was Completed When Rome Destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple.  Other interpreters have held that the seventy weeks were fulfilled with the coming of Christ, his death and resurrection, and the destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple in AD 70. In this case, Christ began his ministry at the end of the sixty-ninth set of seven, around AD 28. He ministered for approximately three and a half years, then was killed in the middle of the seventieth seven. The remaining half-seven ended when the “ruler”—one or more of the Roman rulers—destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple in AD 70. The war and its miseries now continue between God’s people and the kingdom of this world to the very end, when Christ will return, judge the wicked, and establish his Kingdom.\nPassages for Further Study\nDan 7:8, 11, 20-21, 24-27; 8:9-14; 9:24-27; 11:29-31, 40-45; 12:7, 11; 2 Thes 2:3-12; 1 Jn 2:18-22; 4:3; 2 Jn 1:7; Rev 13:1, 5; 16:13-14; 17:11; 19:20-21; 20:10",

    "content": "Resurrection in the Old Testament\nMany Old Testament passages suggest that the realm of the dead is a place from which people do not return (see, e.g., Job 7:6-21; Ps 6:5; Isa 38:18-19). Yet some passages do seem to hint at the notion of resurrection (see, e.g., Job 19:25-27; Ps 16:10-11; Isa 26:19). Daniel 12:1-3 clearly teaches that the dead will be resurrected, and Daniel was told that he would be raised in this resurrection (12:13). Belief in the resurrection of the dead became more widespread during the intertestamental period, as evidenced by the popularity of this notion in the time of Jesus.\nAccording to this passage from Daniel, the resurrection will not be the same for all people. Two distinct groups of people will be raised: (a) those resurrected to experience new life and (b) those resurrected to experience shame. These two groups are distinguished by moral, ethical, and spiritual characteristics. The resurrection will unveil the true nature of a person, and there will be an ethical and spiritual accounting to God Most High.\nThe first group will experience a new existence called “everlasting life.” The expression is found only here in the Old Testament, and it seems to refer here more to the quality of life than to its length. Those who experience this life are refined, cleansed, and made pure before their God. The moral and ethical glory of those resurrected in Daniel’s first group is indicated by the metaphors “shine as bright as the sky” and “shine like the stars forever.” The second group experiences everlasting shame and disgrace instead of everlasting life because they are not morally, ethically, or spiritually renewed. The New Testament book of Revelation expands upon these two groups of Daniel’s vision (see Rev 20:4-6, 11-15).\nGod’s people will finally be rescued from death. Those who are raised to life have had their names inscribed in the Book of Life (see Dan 7:9-10; 10:21; Rev 20:12), and the Judge—the Ancient One—approves of them.\nPassages for Further Study\nJob 19:25-27; Dan 12:1-3, 13; Matt 27:50-53; 28:1-20; 1 Cor 15:1-58; Rev 20:1-15",

    "content": "Knowing God\nFrom our perspective, knowledge tends to mean information, facts, and concepts. But in biblical times, knowledge was centered in personal relationships. To know someone is to enter into a close relationship with that person. Knowing God involves much more than simply mastering facts and information about him. It even transcends discussions about the nature and character of God, as important as those are. Knowing God means entering into a close relationship with him. It means viewing everything as God does and learning to imitate him. Knowing God will transform our thoughts and actions, our priorities and values, and our relationships with fellow human beings. It is far more important than religious rites, sacrifices and burnt offerings, or any other religious activities (see Jer 9:23-24; 31:34).\nThe prophet Hosea strongly emphasizes the importance of knowing God. He demonstrates that Israel would ultimately be destroyed (Hos 4:6) because they did not know God (4:1). This theme of knowing God is also prevalent in the New Testament Gospel of John. Jesus repeatedly stresses the need to know God, affirming that people can be heavily involved in religious practice but have no genuine relationship with God (see John 7:25-29; 8:14-19, 54-55; 14:6-11; 17:1-3).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 33:8, 11; Num 12:6-8; Isa 11:9; 43:10; Jer 9:24; 31:33-34; Hos 6:3, 6; John 17:3; Phil 3:10; Titus 1:16; Heb 8:10-13; 1 Jn 2:4; 4:6, 8; 3 Jn 1:11",

    "content": "Social Justice\nIn the Old Testament, prophets often confronted evil in society and articulated a demand for social justice. An early example of this is found in Elijah’s response to the murder of Naboth, followed by his rebuke of Ahab (1 Kgs 21:16-24, 800s BC). The social aspect of the prophetic message became even more prominent among the prophets of the 700s BC (Hosea and Amos in Israel, Micah and Isaiah in Judah), with Amos as the most articulate spokesman on this issue.\nAmos was appalled by Israel’s abuse of the powerless (Amos 2:6-8; 3:10). Unlike the surrounding nations, Israel had known God in a uniquely personal and intimate manner and then turned away from him (2:9-12; 3:1-2). The people of Israel had refused to worship God appropriately and had oppressed the powerless, so God would hold them accountable and meet them in judgment (4:12), not mercy. God wants justice to flow like a mighty river (Amos 5:24). Those who oppose it will be swept away.\nThe importance of social justice is also made clear in the New Testament. Jesus drew a connection between proper worship and the practice of social justice, warning of the judgment that is coming upon those who do not express their faith in loving action toward others (see Matt 25:31-46). Right understanding must be matched by right practice, which serves as evidence of one’s faith (see Luke 10:25-37; John 13:35). Jesus’ followers recoginzed the significant role social justice needed to play within the early Christian communities (see Acts 2:44-45; Gal 2:9-10; 1 Tim 5:3-16; Jas 1:27–2:26; 1 Jn 3:17-19).\nGod’s compassion for the oppressed is evidenced throughout Scripture. As followers of Christ, we must not neglect those who are in need, and like the prophets, we must confront injustice wherever it is encountered.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 23:1-12; Lev 19:9-18; Deut 10:17-20; 16:18-20; 24:10-22; 1 Kgs 21:1-24; 2 Chr 19:4-11; Pss 94:20-23; 146:3-9; Prov 22:8-9; 31:8-9; Eccl 5:8-9; Isa 1:17; 5:7; 9:6-7; 10:1-2; 42:1-4; 58:4-12; Amos 2:6-8; 5:7-17, 23-24; Matt 12:15-21; 23:23; Luke 10:25-37; Heb 1:8-9",

    "content": "Worship in Jerusalem\nThe Old Testament prophets realized that genuine worship depends on a proper understanding of God and his requirements. God had determined that the Temple in Jerusalem would be the central location of worship for his people. The Lord roared from Zion and thundered from Jerusalem (1:2). It was unacceptable for the Israelites to set up a central worship site in any place other than his authorized Temple in Jerusalem. But after the Israelite kingdom divided, the king of the north, Jeroboam, established alternative worship centers and discouraged his people from going to Jerusalem to worship. Over time, various worship sites were constructed—in the north and the south. But no matter how many sacrifices were offered or how elaborate the rituals performed there (5:4-5), these were not the places for worship God had chosen.\nIn the New Testament, worship is no longer tied to a particular location; worship may occur wherever believers choose to gather (see Matt 18:20). But it must be conducted as God directs: “in spirit and in truth” (John 4:23-24). In both the Old and New Testaments, an emphasis is placed upon the authenticity of worship.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 12:5; 1 Kgs 11:36; 2 Chr 6:6; Neh 1:9; 11:1; Isa 2:3; 52:1; 56:7; Joel 3:17; Amos 5:4-5; Zech 8:20-22; Matt 4:5; Luke 19:46; John 2:16; 4:21-24; Heb 12:18-29; Rev 21:2, 10; 22:19",

    "content": "God’s Sovereignty over All Nations\nIn the ancient world, nations often considered religion in terms of a national god or gods. The king of Aram, for example, believed Israel’s “gods” were tied to the hills and would not be able to act elsewhere (1 Kgs 20:23). Jephthah demonstrated a pagan heritage by saying that the god Chemosh had given the Ammonites their land (Judg 11:24). The prophet Amos, by contrast, knew that God alone had brought the Philistines from Crete and the Arameans from Kir (Amos 9:7). God had created the entire cosmos, not just Israel (4:13; 5:8), so he was perfectly justified in requiring that nations conduct their affairs with justice and mercy (1:3–2:3).\nOne heresy prevalent among the people of Judah and Israel was that, in spite of their sinfulness, God would eventually vindicate them because of his covenant with them (see Jer 7:4; Amos 3:1-2; 9:10). They developed a false theology of the day of the Lord: They thought that God’s intervention in history automatically meant deliverance for them and destruction for their enemies. Amos directly confronted this false notion of privilege (9:7; see also 5:18-20). The day of the Lord would not absolve sinful Israel; rather, God would use it to punish them.\nIsrael’s position of privilege among the nations made them more responsible, not less. While the surrounding nations would be punished for their particularly grievous sins, Israel would be punished for all their sins (3:2). The New Testament further develops this theme of the greater responsibility of God’s people: Those who receive much are responsible for much (Luke 12:48; Jas 3:1).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 15:18; Deut 32:8; 1 Chr 29:11-12; 2 Chr 20:6; Pss 2:1-12; 7:6-8; 10:16; 22:28; 47:2; 83:18; 93:1-5; 103:19; Dan 2:20-21, 47; 4:34-37; Amos 9:7; Matt 28:18-20; Acts 17:24-26; 1 Tim 1:17; 6:15; Rev 15:3-4; 17:14; 19:16",

    "content": "What Is Good\nMicah 6:8, a well-known and oft-memorized verse, answers a series of questions put forth by a confused people who had lost their moral and spiritual bearings.\nThe people of Israel wanted to know what they could do to be acceptable to the Lord. In an oppressive and deceitful society, they had lost their sense of what the Lord regards as good. God gave them a concrete answer: He is not seeking mechanical, ritualistic worship (6:6-7), but that his people do what is right in relationship with him and in their relationships with each other. As they are motivated by love, their actions will be marked by justice, mercy, and humility. God’s people are not to oppress others, but to do what is just, righteous, and honest toward one another.\nMicah 6:8 summarizes what God had already made known in the past to Israel: Humility, faith, and obedience are pleasing to him. God declared this message to Abraham (Gen 15:6; 17:1, 9), to Moses at Sinai (Exod 20–23), through his prophets (e.g., Deut 6:1-8; Hos 6:6), and through Israel’s wise men (Prov 1:7).\nIt pleases God when his people walk humbly in faith before him, as exemplified by Moses (Num 12:3), Habakkuk (Hab 3:17-19), Daniel (Dan 9:1-19), and Ezra (Ezra 9:5-15). Real spirituality and devotion result in doing good, seeking justice, relieving oppression, defending orphans, and aiding widows (see Exod 22:21-24; 23:2-12; Deut 15:4-11; 24:12-15; Neh 5:1-13; Jer 22:16; Dan 4:27; Amos 5:7-24; Jas 1:27).

    "content": "Human Perplexity and God’s Purpose\nGod is not an absent deity, or one who only intervenes on a rare occasion. He is intimately involved and active in what comes to pass in this world so that everything might work toward his purpose (2:3, 14; see also Ps 47:9; Acts 17:24-26; Col 1:15-20). The Lord is a holy and merciful God who acts in history to redeem his people (Hab 3:2-15; see also Eph 1:3-10; 2 Pet 3:15) so that all may ultimately see his glory (Hab 2:14).\nBut often the ways in which God works out his purposes are confusing to his people. Such perplexity is evidenced in the prophetic book of Habakkuk. Habakkuk had a candid relationship with God: The prophet felt free to bring his honest concerns to the Lord, and God did not rebuke him for doing so. From Habakkuk’s perspective, God seemed inactive in the face of the violence and social injustice plaguing Judah (Hab 1:2-4). God then revealed that he would take action: He was going to raise up the Babylonians—a nation even more wicked than Judah—to punish Judah (1:5-11). This further perplexed Habakkuk. Yet God’s assurance that justice would be done, along with a vision of God’s glory, brought the prophet to settled faith and praise (3:16-19).\nHabakkuk’s journey is similar to that of most believers. When times of doubt and discouragement come, believers can approach the Lord and pour out their questions and concerns to him. He may not provide all the answers, and the answers he does provide may not be what we want to hear. But like Habakkuk, we may receive a fresh glimpse of who God is and what he is like, which will enable us to renew our trust in the One who is in control.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 29:29; Pss 47:9; 139:6; 145:3; Isa 55:8-9; Dan 4:25, 35; Hab 1:2-11; 2:2-20; 3:2-19; Acts 17:24-26; Rom 11:33-34; 13:1; Eph 1:3-10; Col 1:15-20; 2 Pet 3:15",

    "content": "Spiritual Renewal in the Later Prophets\nHaggai repeatedly charged his audience to reflect on how their current situation resulted from neglecting their relationship with God (Hag 1:5-7; 2:15-18). God’s chastisement in a series of natural disasters called for repentance (2:17). Haggai recognized that spiritual renewal had to accompany the physical reconstruction of the Temple (1:12).\nThe theme of spiritual renewal helps tie the postexilic prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi together. God had indeed brought his people back to their land, as he had promised through the earlier prophets. But the people still needed to attend to their spiritual condition, or they would face additional difficulties. The continuing prospect of failure to obey God during the postexilic period highlights the need for the appearance of the Lord’s “servant” (see Hag 2:23, initially applied to Zerubbabel but later interpreted as pointing to the Messiah). A righteous shepherd-king was coming (Zech 9:9; see also Mal 3:1). God’s presence among his people would return in a definitive way, creation would be restored, and worship of the Lord would be universal.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 30:2-4; Ps 22:27; Isa 11:9–12:6; 44:22, 26-28; 61:6-7; Jer 24:4-7; Amos 4:6-12; Hag 1:7-15; Zech 9:9; 14:9; Mal 3:1",

    "content": "Returning to the Lord\nThe Old Testament prophets often communicated—both before and after the Exile—the need for the people of Israel to return to the Lord (see, e.g., Isa 55:6-7; Hos 6:1-3; Hag 1:12; Mal 3:7). Their abandonment of the true God—and their turning toward other gods—precipitated his judgment, which culminated in the destruction of the Temple and exile from their land. The future restoration and blessing of God’s people was dependent on their returning to him.\nThis is the core message of Zechariah to those returning to Jerusalem from exile, as seen in his opening statement: “Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies” (Zech 1:3). Zechariah’s call to repentance was a call for the people of Israel to renew their commitment to their covenant relationship with God. Zechariah warned his audience to learn from their ancestors’ past violation of the covenant, which had devastating consequences (7:11-14).\nZechariah’s interest in Israel’s covenant relationship with God extended to issues of social justice. Returning to the Lord leads naturally to obedience and to the practice of justice, honesty, fairness, mercy, and kindness (7:9-10; 8:16-17). Zechariah’s concern for right relationship with God and others anticipated Jesus’ later teaching on the most important commandments: to love God above all, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself (Matt 22:34-40).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 7:2-11; Isa 1:16-20; 55:7; Hos 6:1-3; 14:1-7; Hag 1:12; Zech 1:3; 7:9-14; 8:16-17; Mal 3:7; Matt 3:2-10; 22:34-40; Acts 17:24-31",

    "content": "The Return of God’s Presence with His People\nThe descriptions of the Exile include the tragedy that, as part of his judgment, God withdrew his presence from his people and from the holy city of Jerusalem. This notion is perhaps most clearly demonstrated in a vision of the prophet Ezekiel, who saw a visual depiction of God’s glorious presence leaving the Temple (Ezek 10:1-22; 11:22-23). As such, when the prophets discussed the future restoration of God’s people and their return to the land, they also often spoke of the return of God’s presence (see, e.g., Isa 52:7-8; Ezek 43:1-9).\nThe prophet Zechariah placed a strong emphasis on this theme of the Lord returning to his people. He was certain that God would once again live among them and that the glory of the Lord would rest in Jerusalem (1:16; 2:5, 10-11; 8:3, 23). God’s presence would return with the rebuilding of the Temple, and Israel would experience spiritual restoration and renewed agricultural bounty (1:17; 4:8-9; 6:15; see also Hag 2:19). In the future, God’s presence would rescue Jerusalem and the people of Israel from enemy nations. The Lord would be enthroned as King over all the earth, and the whole earth would worship the one true God (Zech 9:16; 10:6; 12:9; 14:9). In both the present and the future, the return of the Lord’s presence to Jerusalem was connected with the enabling work of God’s Spirit (4:6; 12:10; see also Hag 2:5).\nZechariah’s promise of the Lord’s presence in Jerusalem anticipated the coming of Jesus the Messiah and the awesome mystery of the Word of God becoming human and living on earth among us (John 1:14).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 26:3; 31:3; Exod 3:12; Deut 31:23; Josh 1:5; Judg 6:16; Isa 7:14; 43:2; 52:8; Ezek 37:27; Joel 3:21; Hag 2:5; Zech 1:16-17; 2:5, 10-11; 4:6; 8:3, 23; 14:9; John 1:14",

    "content": "God’s Commitment to His People\nSometimes, from the perspective of God’s people, it seems that God is being slow to fulfill his promises. Abraham and Sarah had to wait twenty-five years from the time God first promised to make of them a great nation until their son Isaac was born. After God promised the kingship to David, David had to endure many trials under the reign of Saul before God finally established him as king. And though God had promised to bring a remnant back to the Promised Land after the Exile, the Jewish captives had to wait seventy years to return. Yet in each case, God indeed brought about the fulfillment of his promises.\nZechariah prophesied around the time that the Temple was being rebuilt after the Exile. At one point during the reconstruction, God told Zechariah not to “despise these small beginnings” (Zech 4:10). God had acted in the past for the ultimate good of his people, even in the exile to Babylon (see 7:12-14). God would accomplish his purposes for Israel’s well-being in his own time and his own way. The people of Israel could take courage in the present and have hope for the future because God keeps his word and fulfills his promises (4:9).\nGod wants patience and faith from his people, not a strident voice. God kept his word and fulfilled the promises he made indicating that his people would return to Jerusalem and that the Temple would be rebuilt. About five hundred years after Zechariah, God fulfilled the promises that he would bring salvation for all people, by sending Jesus the Messiah into the world. Likewise, Jesus’ words that he will one day return and fully establish his Kingdom can be trusted (see Matt 24:27, 30; see also Acts 1:6-11).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 15:29; 2 Sam 7:28-29; 2 Chr 36:21; Isa 42:1-9; 49:15; Zech 2:13; 4:9-10; 14:3; John 14:1-4; 17:17; Acts 1:6-11; Titus 1:2; Rev 21:5",

    "content": "God’s Love for Israel\nThe prophet Malachi’s message to the people of Israel begins, “‘I have always loved you,’ says the Lord” (Mal 1:2). Indeed, God’s love for Israel is evidenced throughout the Old Testament. Malachi’s call to examine the events of history for evidence of God’s love and power connects his book to the larger story of salvation in the Bible. The psalmist, for instance, boldly proclaims the glorious deeds of the Lord to the next generation, so that each generation might “set its hope anew on God, . . . obeying his commands” (Ps 78:2-4, 7). The touchstone for God’s activity in Old Testament history was the exodus from Egypt (see Pss 78:12-13; 105:26-38; 106:7-12). Israel commemorated that event annually in the Festival of Passover and included a catechism for instructing the next generation in the mighty deeds of God (Exod 12–13), so that they would always remember his loving action toward them.\nUnfortunately, the people of Israel frequently forsook God and broke their covenant with him. Even so, his love for them never completely dissipated (see Hos 3:1). Their apostasy resulted in God’s judgment—culminating in exile from their land—but even in the midst of this catastrophe, he preserved a remnant of his people and pledged to restore them (Isa 65:8-9).\nThe Old Testament prophets anticipated a future time when God would display his love for Israel by sending a Branch of David (Isa 11:1-5), a righteous King (Zech 9:9-10), a Sun of Righteousness (Mal 4:1-3). The fulfillment of these prophecies came through Christ, whose death produced another central event for God’s people, also commemorated with a meal—the Lord’s Supper (1 Cor 11:20-34). This redemptive act of God provided the ultimate demonstration of love for his people—both Jews and Gentiles.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 12:1–13:16; Pss 47:4; 78:2-4, 7, 12-13; 98:3; 105:26-27, 37; 106:7-8; Hos 3:1; 11:1; Mal 1:2; 1 Cor 5:7; 11:20-34; 15:1-4",

    "content": "Preaching to a Tough Crowd\nSometimes God calls individuals to proclaim his word to a difficult audience. The listeners may be resistant to God’s truth and may reject both the message and the messenger. This was especially true of the Old Testament prophets, who often proclaimed messages the people did not want to hear (see Jer 26:7-9; 38:1-6; Amos 7:10-13).\nMalachi’s sermons were directed to a tough audience. Among those in his congregation were the disillusioned (Mal 1:2), the cynical (1:7; 2:2), the callous (2:13-16), the dishonest (3:5), the apathetic (3:14-15), the doubters and skeptics, and the truly wicked (see 4:1). What does a preacher say to this kind of crowd?\nMalachi engaged his audience rhetorically through dialogue in a series of disputations. The prophet’s strong rebuke and clever anticipation of his audience’s rebuttals was a wake-up call that hit the mark: “Those who feared the Lord spoke with each other, and the Lord listened to what they said” (3:16).\nLike the prophets, both Jesus and his followers found themselves proclaiming messages to resistant audiences (see, e.g., Luke 4:16-30; John 10:22-40; Acts 5:26-40; 22:30–23:10). But such resistance did not provide impetus for neglecting the God-ordained task of proclaiming his word (see Acts 5:41-42). While those who preach a message from the Lord can hope for a positive response, as in the case of Malachi, such receptivity is by no means guaranteed.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 19:6-11; Exod 17:1-13; Judg 9:1-21; 1 Kgs 22:8-28; Jer 28:1-17; Mal 3:14-18; John 10:24-39; Acts 22:30–23:10",

    "content": "Genealogy of Jesus\nBoth Matthew and Luke provide genealogies of Jesus (Matt 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38). The two genealogies differ for the generations following King David. Matthew follows the line of David’s son Solomon, while Luke follows the line of David’s son Nathan. One possible explanation is that Matthew records Joseph’s genealogy while Luke records Mary’s (in which case Joseph would have been Heli’s son-in-law).\nGenealogies were kept quite accurately in Judaism, as Josephus confirms (Josephus, Life 1). Genealogies were important in the Old Testament and in Judaism generally because land rights were apportioned to families in Israel and because certain offices, such as priest and king, were inherited from father to son. Genealogies sometimes ran a record from the past to the present to illustrate religious themes, family descent, or political ties, as well as simple chronology (1 Chr 1–9). Most such lists were representative rather than a complete list of every individual.\nThe purpose of Matthew’s genealogy, unlike Luke’s, is to show Jesus’ heritage as running from Abraham through David. Jesus’ genealogy confirms him as a legitimate heir to the throne of David. So Jesus’ genealogy in Matthew goes back to Abraham, the father of the Jewish race. By contrast, the genealogy in Luke goes all the way back to Adam. This is consistent with Luke’s emphasis on Jesus as the Savior for all people everywhere.\nIn Matthew’s genealogy, the unusual mention of women with stained reputations (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba), some of them Gentiles, is noteworthy and emphasizes God’s grace to redeem even those deemed unworthy by others.\nJesus’ genealogies do not prove that Jesus is the Messiah, but they do make him a possible candidate. His identity as the Messiah becomes evident in other ways (Matt 11:2-6). God had guided the course of history to its climax. Jesus is the anticipated Messiah of the Old Testament, the Savior of his people, and the King descended from David assuming his throne (see 2 Sam 7:16). He is heir to Abraham and ultimately fulfills God’s promises to Abraham (Gen 12:1-3).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:1-3; 2 Sam 7:16; Matt 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38",

    "content": "The Blessings of Jesus\nThe blessings of Jesus are called Beatitudes because the Vulgate (the Latin translation of the Bible) translates the Greek word for blessed as beati. No single word can capture all that Jesus is communicating with this term here. He is describing the special favor of God toward his people, both physically and spiritually, and the consequences of living within that favor.\nThe Beatitudes describe the lifestyle and character of a follower of Jesus. Jesus calls men and women to follow him as he proclaims the message of the Kingdom to Israel (see also Matt 11:6; 13:16; 16:17; 24:46). Those who are blessed have repented in response to the proclamation of the Kingdom (Matt 4:17-22). The Beatitudes are connected with Isa 61:1-3: The Spirit endows, leads to proclamation, and blesses the poor, the humble, and the righteous.\nThe NLT’s use of “God blesses” conveys the ideas of divine origin and approval (see Matt 25:34), fulfillment (see Matt 11:6; 13:16; 16:17), reversal (see Luke 1:1–2:52; 6:20-26), and the condition of obedience required in order to enjoy the blessings (see Pss 1:1, 3-6; 106:3; 112:1-2; 119:1-2; Prov 8:32; Isa 56:2).

Jas 1:6-7). The term refers to a specific event rather than to ongoing and permanent failure. In Matthew, “little faith” happens either due to lack of knowledge on the part of Jesus’ disciples (Matt 16:8-11) or due to acting without faith during a particular incident. If someone always lacks faith, it is described as “unbelief” (see Matt 13:58). As examples of “little faith,” the disciples do not understand their value or God’s providential protection Matt 6:30; they do not understand God’s protection in the midst of physical danger 8:26; 14:31; they do not understand Jesus’ saying regarding yeast 16:8; and they are not able to exorcise a demon 17:20. These are instances of failure in specific circumstances, not a case of having no faith whatsoever.\nThe term faith reflects at least two ideas: trust (personal reliance upon the Lord) and belief (affirmation of truths). Matthew’s concern with “little faith” is about lack of trust by a follower of Jesus who is in a specific situation, rather than a failure to have basic belief in Jesus as Lord and Savior. Jesus wants his followers not only to believe in him, but also to trust, love, and obey him (see Matt 7:21-29; 22:34-40).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 6:30; 7:21-29; 8:26; 13:58; 14:31; 16:8; 17:20; 22:34-40; Luke 12:28; Jas 1:6-8",

    "content": "Citizenship in the Kingdom\nFirst-century Jews were looking for a king like David or Judas Maccabeus who would overthrow their oppressors. Jesus’ vision of the Kingdom of God was radically different from these expectations (5:43-48).\nMatthew presents Jesus as a teacher unlike any other, and the Sermon on the Mount is his longest and most famous sermon. More than simply a collection of Jesus’ ethical or moral teachings, it is a manifesto of citizenship in the Kingdom of Heaven.\nJesus framed the Kingdom of Heaven primarily in terms of (1) an upward relationship with God, (2) an inward change of heart, and (3) outward relationships with other people. This new message of the Kingdom was compelling to Jesus’ hearers (7:28-29).\nThe tendency is to make hard distinctions between these three areas, but all three are always present. For example, Jesus’ instruction to humility (5:5) at first seems simply inward, but it is also about attitude toward God and others. The command not to resist an evil person (5:39) seems outward-focused, but often requires active faith in God and internal fortitude. Jesus’ instruction on prayer (6:5-15) is primarily about our relationship with God, but prayer requires an internal recognition of need and is often about relationships with others.\nCitizenship in the Kingdom of Heaven has a central requirement: Those who wish to follow Jesus and enter the Kingdom of Heaven must stop living self-centered lives and instead live God-centered ones. Those who try to achieve righteousness on their own still have self at the center and are still living in darkness. The call of Jesus is to live a life of true righteousness – the righteousness of God himself (5:20, 48). This is not a righteousness that can be attained. Instead, Jesus gives it to those who follow him.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 7:24-29; 13:1-52; Mark 10:14-16; Luke 8:1-3; 9:1-6; John 3:1-21; Acts 8:12; 28:23-31",

    "content": "The Son of Man\n“Son of Man” was Jesus’ favorite way to refer to himself. The phrase is just as odd in Greek as in English: It translates the Hebrew phrase ben ’adam, an idiom that means “human being” or “person” (see, e.g., Ezek 2:1-8). One reason Jesus preferred this name was because it was not an inflammatory title such as “Christ” or “Messiah.” The expression is used in three ways in the Gospels:\n(1) The background to Jesus’ use of the title is Dan 7:13-14, where an exalted messianic figure “like a son of man” (that is, having human form) comes with the clouds of heaven and is given great glory and power. Jesus understood himself as the one who would return to earth in the clouds of heaven (see Mark 8:38; 13:26; 14:62). Sometimes Jesus used “Son of Man” in this sense, to refer to his role as judge, deliverer, savior, and vindicator (Matt 10:23; 13:41; 16:27; 19:28; 24:27, 30, 37, 44; 25:31; 26:64).\n(2) Often Jesus used “Son of Man” to describe himself as a suffering redeemer (12:40; 17:9, 12, 22; 20:18, 28; 26:2, 24, 45). This sense is rooted in Isa 52:13–53:12.\n(3) At times, Jesus apparently used “Son of Man” to refer to himself as the representative of humans (Matt 8:20; 11:19; 12:8, 32; 13:37). The book of Ezekiel uses “son of man” in a similar sense (e.g., Ezek 2:1-8).\nJesus did not use “Son of Man” to distinguish his humanity from his deity (“Son of God”). By using this title, Jesus could define himself as Messiah on his own terms. He used “Son of Man” to describe his total identity and as a veiled suggestion that those who watched and heard him should pay attention to who he is.\nPassages for Further Study\nEzek 2:1-8; 3:1, 4, 10, 17, 25; 4:1; Dan 7:13-14; 8:17; Matt 8:18-22; 9:6; 10:23; 11:19; 12:8, 32, 40; 13:37, 41; 16:13, 27-28; 17:9, 12, 22; 19:28; 20:18, 28; 24:27, 30, 37-39, 44; 25:31; 26:2, 24, 45, 64; Mark 2:10; John 1:51; 3:13-14; 5:27; 6:27, 53, 62; 8:28; 9:35; 12:23, 34; 13:31; Acts 7:56; Heb 2:6; Rev 1:13; 14:14",

    "content": "Eating Together\nEating meals together was a religious matter among the Pharisees and other observant Jews. Righteous Jews enacted many regulations to prevent themselves from being ceremonially defiled at meals. It was not done so much to exclude others as to show commitment to the law.\nMost Jews lived by the food laws most of the time. Jesus did so, too. But he regularly, purposefully, and offensively ate with those who were ritually unclean or whose commitment to the law was inferior. Sharing a meal with another indicated both covenantal and social equality (cp. Matt 26:26-29; 2 Kgs 25:27-30). The Pharisees, believing that separation from such sinners was a necessity for righteousness, were offended by Jesus’ sharing meals with such people (Matt 9:10-11; 11:19; 21:28-32; Luke 7:36-50; 15:1-2; 19:1-10).\nJesus’ sharing meals with sinful people enacted God’s grace—he extended God’s love and forgiveness, welcoming open participation in a new society. This practice developed into the early Christian communion meals (Acts 2:46; 1 Cor 11:17-34). And as is clear from the Last Supper, the meals Jesus shared with his followers anticipated the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven (Matt 26:29; see 8:11-12). The apostle Paul extended Jesus’ practice to enable fellowship between Jews and Gentiles in the church (see Gal 2:11-21). Jesus tore down the barriers separating us from one another and from God (Eph 2:14-18) and calls us into fellowship with all his people.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 18:1-8; Exod 24:9-11; 2 Kgs 25:27-30; Matt 8:11-12; 9:10-13; 11:19; 26:26-29; Luke 7:36-50; 15:1-2; 19:1-10; 22:14-21; Acts 2:46-47; 1 Cor 11:20-34; Gal 2:11-16; Eph 2:14-18",

    "content": "Compassionate Healer\nJesus is frequently described as one who “had compassion.” This expression (sometimes translated “felt sorry” or “took pity”) is used of Jesus in complex situations where (1) distress is expressed (Matt 18:23-26; 20:29-33) and Jesus remedies the distress (Matt 18:27; 20:34), (2) Jesus shows deep emotion (Matt 14:14; 15:32; 18:27; 20:34), or (3) there is a contrast with those who are not compassionate (Matt 9:32-36; 18:27-30; 20:29-34). In the Gospels, the phrase “had compassion” refers only to Jesus directly, but is also used in parables where it can refer to God the Father or to Jesus (Matt 18:27; Luke 10:33; 15:20).\nIn the Old Testament, the term compassion is used for God’s covenant love for Israel. God withdrew this compassion to judge Israel’s obstinate unfaithfulness (Isa 27:11; 63:15; Jer 13:14). God restored his compassion when Israel repented (Deut 13:18; 30:2-3; Prov 28:13; Isa 55:7). The Old Testament often describes the messianic age as a time of God’s compassion (Isa 14:1; 49:10, 13; 54:8, 10; 60:10; Jer 12:15; 33:26; Ezek 39:25; Mic 7:19; Hab 3:2; Zech 10:6). The resurgence of this notion in the Gospels reflects this, as the messianic age has dawned and God’s covenant love is once again active in Israel.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 13:18; 30:3; 1 Kgs 8:50-51; Prov 28:13; Isa 14:1; 49:10, 13; 54:7-10; 55:7; 60:10; Jer 12:14-15; 33:26; Ezek 39:25; Mic 7:18-20; Hab 3:2; Zech 1:16; 10:6; Matt 9:35-36; 14:14; 15:32; 18:23-30; 20:29-34; Luke 10:33-37; 15:20-32",

In Matthew, he is called “Satan” (meaning Adversary; 4:10), the “devil” (4:1-11; 13:39), the “tempter” (see footnote on 4:3), the “prince of demons” (9:34), “Beelzeboul” (see footnote on 12:24), the “evil one” (6:13; 13:19), and “the enemy” (13:39).\nJesus’ mission of announcing and bringing in the Kingdom of God inevitably led to conflict with Satan’s forces, including exorcisms (see Matt 8:16-17; 9:32-34; 10:1, 7-8; 12:22-29; Mark 5:1-20). Matthew records that Satan has power over kingdoms (4:8-9; 12:26) and that he has angels at his command (see footnote on 25:41). Satan’s primary tool is temptation, and his goal is to generate disobedience to God (Matt 4:1-11; 6:13; 16:23). Since Christ is the agent of God for the salvation of human beings, Satan fervently attacked Christ (Matt 4:1-11; John 13:27). But Christ has defeated him and will eventually strip Satan of all his powers (Matt 25:41; John 12:31; Rev 20:1-10).\nPassages for Further Study\nJob 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Zech 3:1-2; Matt 4:1-11; 13:19; 16:23; Luke 10:17-20; 13:16; 22:3, 31-32; John 12:31; 13:27; Acts 5:3; 26:17-18; 2 Cor 4:4; 11:13-14; 1 Tim 2:14; 5:15; Rev 12:9; 20:1-10",

    "content": "The Messiah\nThe Greek term christos is equivalent to the Hebrew mashiakh (“anointed one”), and both terms can be translated as “Messiah.”\nIn Judaism, the term messiah was understood in a variety of ways. The Old Testament refers to people, not all of them honorable, who were specially anointed by God for a variety of reasons or tasks (Exod 28:41; 1 Sam 9:16; 1 Kgs 19:16; Isa 45:1).The prophets expected a future Messiah who would usher in God’s Kingdom (Dan 9:25-26; Zech 9:9-10). The dominant expectation among Jews in Jesus’ time was that the Messiah would be a political warrior who would lead Israel to victory over its oppressors and reestablish Israel as a separate kingdom (see Psalms of Solomon 17–18). Some Jews saw the Messiah as a forerunner of the Kingdom of God. The community at Qumran, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, expected a Messiah who would function both as a priest and as a political warrior.\nGiven such ambiguity, it is not surprising that Jesus avoided the title. He taught his followers that he would suffer according to Isaiah’s predictions (Isa 52:13–53:12, which Jews interpreted as referring to the nation of Israel). The emphasis Jesus gave to suffering and service as the path of victory (Matt 16:21-28; 20:25-28) collided with the popular Jewish paradigm of the Messiah as a royal conqueror. It was, however, God’s means of bringing about his Kingdom (see Luke 2:25-32; John 12:37-50; Acts 2:29-36).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 17:6; Exod 28:41; 1 Sam 9:16; Isa 52:13–53:12; Dan 9:25-26; Zech 9:9-10; Matt 2:4-6; 11:2-6; 16:13-20; 17:10-12; 22:41-46; 24:23-27; 26:62-65; Luke 2:8-11, 25-35; 3:15-18; 23:35-43; 24:26-27, 46-47; John 4:21-29; 7:25-27, 31, 40-43; 12:34-50; 20:30-31; Acts 2:22-36; 3:17-26; 4:25-28; 9:22; 13:23-25; 17:3; 26:22-23; 28:17-24",

Though he was born in David’s line, his mother’s reputation was tainted (Matt 1:18-25). Jesus himself was from Nazareth (Matt 2:23), a very unprestigious place (see Matt 13:53-58). His ministry was in Galilee, a backwater distant from official Judaism (see Matt 4:12-16). His closest associate was the inexplicable John, who baptized people and prophetically castigated the political leaders (Matt 11:2-19; 14:3-12). Jesus was evasive in his dialogues (e.g., Matt 13:10-15; 17:24-27; 19:3-12; 21:23-27), he refused to produce signs proving his messianic claims (12:38-42; 16:1-4), and he was accompanied by outcasts of society (9:9-13; 11:16-19). He offended Jewish sensibilities, disregarded Jewish traditions (5:17-20; 9:14-17; 12:1-14; 15:1-20; 21:12-13), and purposefully avoided recognition (8:4; 12:15-21). His revelations were reserved for the unlikely (11:25-27; 13:16-17; 16:13-20), and he often spoke of his own humiliating death (16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; 26:2). Jesus did not come with the flash and spark of someone in need of attention, nor did he make his status and calling glowingly obvious. Instead, he chose the path of humility, privacy, and revelation recognized by faith.\nIn the end, Jesus was vindicated: He won arguments (Luke 20:20-40), exorcized demons (Matt 8:28-34), healed wondrously (Matt 9:1-8), raised people from the dead (Matt 9:18-26), and ultimately rose from the dead himself (Matt 28:1-10). His divisive but effective ministry inaugurated God’s Kingdom (Matt 11:2-6).\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 3:8; 8:14-15; 28:12-13; 59:9-10; Jer 13:16; 20:11; 31:7-9; 50:31-32; Hos 4:4-6; 5:5; 14:9; Mal 2:7-9; Matt 11:5-6; 13:54-58; 17:27; 21:42-46; Mark 6:3; Luke 20:17-19; John 6:60-69; Rom 9:30-33; 11:7-12; 14:12-13, 20-21; 1 Cor 1:21-23; 8:9-13; 10:31–11:1; 2 Cor 6:3; Gal 5:11; 1 Pet 2:5-8; 1 Jn 2:10",

    "content": "Faith and Good Deeds\nJesus did not teach salvation by works—he taught the necessity of a conversion (an internal reorientation toward God by an act of God’s grace), which results in a life of obedience. Good works are the natural consequence of a relationship with Jesus Christ (see, e.g., Matt 7:15-20; 12:33-37; 15:15-20).\nThe parable of the sheep and the goats is an example of the indissoluble link between faith and works. The connection between faith, works, and final approval is a consistent feature of Jesus’ teachings (e.g., Matt 7:13-27; 13:3-9, 18-23; 16:27). For Jesus, works are a sure indicator of faith, which begins with repentance—a conversion of the heart and mind that involves turning away from sin to God (Matt 4:17; see also 3:2, 8-10; 11:20-24; 12:38-42).\nA misapplication of the concept of salvation by grace alone has led to a false dichotomy between faith and works. Salvation is not achieved by works, but neither is it without works (see Gal 5:6, 21; Eph 2:10; 5:5; 1 Jn 1:5-10; Rev 21:8). Jesus promises blessing and reward to those who live in accord with God’s will (Matt 5:3-12). Consequently, righteousness is required of those who want to enter the Kingdom (5:20-48; 7:21; 22:11-14; 23:3). Faith that does not result in works is not saving faith (Jas 2:14-26).\nJames, in his conspicuous emphasis on faithfulness to God, argues for charitable deeds as an expression of faith (2:14-26). A faith relationship with God cannot be based merely on believing a true statement (2:19). Saving faith results in actions (1:22-25; 2:14). Faithful actions emulate God, who generously gives good gifts (1:5, 17; 4:6). Faith and good deeds are therefore inseparable. As with Abraham, good deeds show that a person has complete faith and is righteous before God (2:23; see Gen 15:6).\nJesus taught and modeled faith that does good deeds (see Matt 5:13-16), and Paul also affirmed the need for good deeds (Rom 2:6; Gal 6:5-10; Eph 2:10; Phil 2:12-13; 1 Thes 1:3). James points to some specific actions which demonstrate faith, including caring for orphans and widows (1:27), avoiding favoritism toward the rich (2:1-7), providing food and clothing for the poor (2:15-17), controlling one’s tongue (3:1-12), promoting peace (3:17-18), and refraining from judging others (4:11-12). All of these things can be understood as “faith expressing itself in love” (Gal 5:6).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 17:1; 22:1-19; Lev 22:31; Hab 2:4; Matt 3:2, 8-10; 4:17; 5:3-12, 20-48; 7:13-27; 10:32-33; 11:20-24; 12:33-42; 13:3-9, 18-23; 15:15-20; 16:27; 25:31-46; John 15:2; Rom 2:6; Gal 5:6, 16-26; 6:5-10; Eph 2:8-10; 5:3-9; Phil 2:12-13; Heb 11:1-40; Jas 2:14-26; 1 Jn 1:5-10; Rev 21:6-8",

    "content": "The Resurrection of Jesus\nScripture unanimously depicts the personal and bodily resurrection of Jesus from the dead by the power of God, but numerous other attempts to explain it have emerged: (1) Jesus never really died—instead, he lost consciousness and regained it after being laid in a cool tomb (the swoon theory); (2) the disciples of Jesus stole his body and then lied about a resurrection (see Matt 28:12-15); (3) the disciples had hallucinations and dreams that they mistakenly confused with a physical resurrection; and (4) the resurrection is a personal experience in the heart of faith, not an event in history. Behind such suggestions lies a deep-seated skepticism toward the supernatural, or at least toward whether a miraculous event could have happened. Such suggestions fail to take into account the fact that for New Testament authors and their audiences, the term resurrection could only have meant the literal reanimation of a dead corpse (see 1 Cor 15).\nThe historicity of Jesus’ resurrection and the historical reliability of the biblical accounts are supported by (1) the evidence of an empty tomb; (2) the presence of women as witnesses (no one would have made up a story with women as witnesses, since the testimony of a woman was considered to be less reliable than that of a man); (3) the varied but basically unified accounts of Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances; (4) the transformation of the disciples from a fearful band into fearless followers; and (5) the disciples’ ability to overcome the scandal of following a crucified man (Deuteronomy 21:23 indicates that one who dies such a death has fallen under God’s curse). Judaism had no concept of a dying and rising Messiah that could conveniently be applied to Jesus. Inventing something no one would find conceivable would have made little sense. The most reasonable conclusion is just what the New Testament announces: that Jesus did, in fact, rise from the dead.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 16:21; 17:9, 23; 20:19; 26:32; 28:1-10; Mark 14:28; Luke 9:22; 14:14; John 2:19-22; 5:21; 6:39-40; 11:1-44; 14:20; 21:14; Acts 1:21-22; 2:22-36; 3:15, 26; 4:2, 10, 33; 5:30; 10:39-40; 13:29-31; 17:18, 32; 23:6-10; Rom 1:4; 4:24-25; 6:4-5, 9; 7:4; 8:11, 34; 10:9; 1 Cor 6:14; 15:4, 12-23, 35, 42-44, 52; 2 Cor 1:9; 4:14; 5:15; Gal 1:1; Eph 1:19-20; 2:5-6; Phil 3:10-11; Col 2:12; 3:1; 1 Thes 1:10; 4:14; 2 Tim 2:8, 18; Heb 6:2; 11:35; 1 Pet 1:21; 3:18, 21; Rev 20:4-8, 11-15",

    "content": "The Coming of God’s Kingdom\nA central component of Jesus’ message was that God’s Kingdom had arrived. The arrival of God’s Kingdom was eagerly awaited by the people of Israel, for it would fulfill the many promises of God that had not yet been realized:\nThe Spirit would not only come again, as he had in the past, but he would come upon each individual believer in fulfillment of Joel 2:28-32 (cp. Acts 2:16-21).\nSatan would be defeated (Mark 3:27; Luke 10:17-18), as was already being demonstrated by Jesus’ exorcisms (Mark 1:21-28; 5:1-20; Luke 11:20).\nThe new covenant promised in Jer 31:31-34 would be established (Mark 14:24).\nThe resurrection from the dead would produce its firstfruits (Mark 8:31; 9:9, 31; 10:33-34; 16:6; 1 Cor 15:20, 23).\nGod’s Anointed, the promised Son of David (Matt 2:1-12; Luke 2:25-38) would arrive.\nThese dimensions of God’s Kingdom have already been fulfilled in the birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus. People are to repent and believe the gospel because God’s Kingdom has arrived in the person of Jesus (Matt 4:23; 6:10; Mark 1:14-15; 4:26-32; Luke 4:42-43).\nWith the coming of the Kingdom through Jesus, things radically changed in Israel. The Spirit was once again active in the land, working through the prophet John the Baptist and in the ministry of Jesus. For those with eyes to see, the promised Messiah, or Christ, had appeared. Because God’s Kingdom was with them in the person of Jesus, the disciples could not fast like the Pharisees and the disciples of John the Baptist (Mark 2:18-20). Fasting became inappropriate, for the Old Testament promises were being fulfilled. It was time to celebrate and feast (Mark 2:19-20), because God’s reign had begun. People were already entering into the Kingdom (Mark 10:23-31) and experiencing its manifestations (Mark 9:1).\nThere is a future, not-yet-realized dimension of God’s Kingdom that awaits Christ’s return (Mark 14:25). The ultimate judgment of evil, the final establishment of justice, and the eradication of disease, poverty, and even death will find their fulfillment when Jesus, the Son of Man, returns in glory, gathers his elect (Mark 13:24-27; Titus 2:11-14), judges the world (Mark 8:38; 14:62; Matt 25:31-46; 2 Tim 4:1; Rev 14:14-20), and resurrects the dead (1 Cor 15:12-57; 1 Thes 4:13–5:11). Although the time of Christ’s return is unknown (Mark 13:32), his followers are to be alert and watch for his coming (13:33-37) in anticipation of their blessed hope (Titus 2:13).\nPassages for Further Study\nJer 31:31-34; Joel 2:28-32; Matt 4:23; 5:3; 6:10; 25:31-46; Mark 1:14-15; 4:11, 26-32; 8:31-38; 9:1, 47; 10:23-25, 29-31; 13:24-27, 32-37; 14:25, 62; Luke 2:25-38; 4:18-19, 42-43; 6:20; 10:18-20; 11:20; Acts 1:6-8; 2:16-21; 1 Cor 15:22-28; Titus 2:11-14",

    "content": "The Secret of the Messiah\nThroughout the Gospel of Mark, Jesus tells others—those he healed or raised from the dead, the disciples who recognized him as the Christ, and the demons who had a correct understanding of his true identity—not to reveal his identity (e.g., Mark 1:34, 44; 3:11-12; 5:43; 7:36; 8:29-30; 9:9; this theme occurs far less frequently in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke—see Matt 8:4; 16:20; Luke 9:21). Why did Jesus command those he healed and those who knew his true identity to keep his healings and identity secret?\nOne possibility relates to how the Roman authorities would have responded to an extremely popular preacher who proclaimed the arrival of God’s Kingdom, performed marvelous healings, and openly allowed his followers to call him Israel’s long-awaited Messiah and King. Roman authorities would not tolerate it—they would immediately seek to suppress such a movement. In the Roman Empire, there was no room for another kingdom or for a messianic rescuer from Roman occupation. Thus, though Jesus acknowledged to his disciples that he was the Messiah (Mark 8:27-30), he did not intend to overthrow Rome.\nAnother possible reason for this secrecy has to do with the prolific misunderstanding of Jesus’ identity that we see throughout the Gospel of Mark, even among his closest followers. Jesus makes clear that his identity as Messiah and Son of God is directly tied to his suffering and death, a reality which did not match up with Jewish expectations regarding the Messiah. Thus, immediately after Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah, Jesus announces that he would suffer and die (Mark 8:27-31), which generates a response from Peter that demonstrates his lack of understanding (8:32-33). It was not his miracles or his profound teaching that served as the primary attribute of his messiahship, but rather his sacrificial death.\nFor these reasons, it was expedient for Jesus to teach about God’s Kingdom in parables (see Mark 4:1-34, especially 4:10-12), to minimize the excitement created by his miracles (1:44; 5:43; 7:36; 8:26), to conceal his presence at times from the people (7:24; 9:30-31), to conceal his teaching from outsiders (4:10-12, 33-34; 7:17), and to command those who knew his true identity not to reveal it (1:23-26, 34; 3:11-12; 8:29-30; 9:9). Jesus came “to give his life as a ransom for many” (10:45), not to lead the nation of Israel in rebellion against Rome.\nNonetheless, Jesus Christ, the Son of God (Mark 1:1), could not be hidden. The secret was not and cannot be kept (7:36), for Jesus is too great. Those who experienced and witnessed his healing touch could not help but proclaim what he had done. Jesus’ identity broke through, and it became clear that he is indeed the Messiah, the Son of God, the Lord over nature, disease, and death. And for the readers of the Gospel of Mark, who are made aware of his identity in the very first verse, Jesus was demonstrated to be the Messiah precisely because of—not in spite of—his suffering, death, and resurrection.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 8:4; 16:20; Mark 1:34, 44; 3:11-12; 5:43; 7:36; 8:29-30; 9:9, 30-31; Luke 9:21",

    "content": "The Son of God\nTime and again Jesus’ healings, exorcisms, raising of the dead, and teachings created wonder, awe, amazement, and fear (e.g., Mark 1:22, 27; 4:41; 5:15, 20, 33; 7:37; 9:15; 10:24, 26, 32; 12:17; 15:5). This amazement emphasizes the miraculous nature of Jesus’ ministry. The Gospel writers wanted their readers to ask themselves, “Who is this man? . . . Even the wind and waves obey him!” (Matt 8:27; Mark 4:41; Luke 8:25). Mark gives the answer at the very beginning of his Gospel: Jesus is “the Messiah, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1).\nIn the Old Testament, the title “Son of God” is applied to the people of Israel (Exod 4:22; Deut 32:5-6, 18-19; Ps 82:6; Jer 3:19; 31:9, 20; Hos 11:1; Mal 2:10) and to angels (Gen 6:2; Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7; Ps 29:1). It is also applied in a special way to Israel’s king—the anointed king was seen as God’s “son” (2 Sam 7:14; 1 Chr 22:10; 28:6; Pss 2:7; 89:26-27). The title also appears in intertestamental Jewish literature (including the Apocrypha and the Dead Sea Scrolls), possibly in reference to the coming Messiah. Jews in the first century would have likely considered the coming Messiah as a “Son of God.”\nJesus’ identity as “the Son of God” was affirmed by God at his baptism (Mark 1:11; Matt 3:17; Luke 3:22) and by demons he encountered during his ministry (Matt 8:29; Mark 1:24; 1:34; 3:11; 5:7; Luke 4:34; 8:28). Later, the disciples recognized Jesus as the Messiah (Matt 16:16; Mark 8:29; Luke 9:20) and Jesus immediately began to teach them of his forthcoming death (Matt 16:21; Mark 8:31; Luke 9:22). Then, at Jesus’ transfiguration, God affirmed the disciples’ confession (Matt 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35). As Jesus approached his death, he affirmed his unique identity as God’s Son, both through his teaching (Mark 12:1-12; 13:32) and at his trial (Mark 14:61-62).\nIn the Gospels, the climactic confession of Jesus’ identity as God’s Son took place at the crucifixion, where a Roman centurion became the first human in the narrative to recognize that Jesus is truly the Son of God (Mark 15:39). While Jesus’ identity as the Son of God is demonstrated in his exorcisms and by his Father’s declarations, his sacrificial death and the way he died (Mark 15:33-39) provide the supreme evidence that he is the Son of God.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 4:22; Deut 32:5-6; 2 Sam 7:14; 1 Chr 22:10; 28:6; Pss 2:7; 89:26-27; Jer 3:19; 31:9, 20; Matt 26:63-68; Mark 1:1, 11, 24; 4:35-41; 8:31; 9:7; 12:1-12; 14:61-62; 15:32-39; Luke 1:32-35; 4:41; John 1:18; 3:16-17, 35-36; 5:19-26; 17:5, 24; 20:31; Acts 13:33; Rom 1:4; 5:10; 8:3, 32; 2 Cor 1:19; Gal 2:20; 4:4-5; Eph 4:13; 1 Thes 1:10; Heb 1:2-14; 3:6; 5:5; 1 Jn 1:3; 2:22; 3:23; 4:9-10, 14; 5:20; 2 Jn 1:3, 9; Rev 2:18",

    "content": "Following Jesus\nOne of the core purposes of the Gospels is to help readers understand and accept the call to take up their cross and follow Jesus. This call is addressed not only to those who would be Jesus’ apostles (Mark 3:13-19; cp. 1:16-20; 2:14) but to all who desired to follow him (Mark 8:34; cp. 2:15; 10:21, 52). For some, the call to discipleship is very hard (Mark 10:17-25), but God provides grace (10:27). Others find it easy to respond to Jesus’ call (Mark 2:14; cp. Luke 7:36-50).\nFor everyone, following Jesus requires a total commitment to turn from selfish ways (Mark 8:34-35). Taking up one’s cross is a metaphor for giving up one’s life to follow Jesus—even to death. For example, Peter, Andrew, James, and John left their homes and their source of income to follow Jesus (Mark 1:16-20). For one rich man, turning from his selfish ways required selling all he had and giving the proceeds to the poor (Mark 10:21). Following Jesus also means being identified with him without being ashamed and being faithful to him and his teachings (Mark 8:38; cp. Rom 10:9). It requires removing anything that would interfere with following Jesus, regardless of how painful doing so might be (Mark 9:43-48). It requires entrusting one’s life entirely to Jesus and repenting of sin (Mark 1:15; 6:12). It even requires putting loyalty to Jesus above loyalty to one’s own father and mother (Matt 10:37; Luke 14:26).\nJesus explicitly commanded his disciples to proclaim his message (Matt 28:18-20; Luke 24:47-49; Acts 1:8). And we see throughout the rest of the New Testament that Jesus’ followers did indeed proclaim the Good News wherever they went, leading to more and more followers (see Acts 2:14-41; 3:12-26; 4:1-2, 20; 8:4; 9:20; 11:19-26; 13:1-3; Rom 1:1-16; 10:14-15; 15:18-21; 1 Cor 9:16; Col 1:23; 1 Thes 2:9; 2 Tim 4:2).\nAlongside Jesus’ demands for discipleship are the rewards of following Jesus. Those who follow Jesus are promised entrance into the Kingdom of God (Mark 9:43-48; 10:23-31). They receive his forgiveness for their sins (Mark 2:10-11; see also 3:28; 11:25), and they become members of the family of God (John 1:12). They are saved from judgment (Mark 8:35; 13:13) and obtain eternal life (Mark 9:43; 10:29-30; 1 Jn 5:11-12).\nPassages for Further Study\nHos 6:3; Matt 10:37-39; 28:18-20; Mark 1:15-20; 2:14-15; 3:13-15; 5:18-20; 6:6-13, 30-32; 8:34-38; 9:38-50; 10:17-31; 11:22-25; 13:9-13; Luke 14:25-35; 24:47-49; John 8:12; 10:27; 12:26; Acts 1:8; 2:42-47; 4:16-20; 8:4; 9:19-30; 11:19-24; 13:1-3; Rom 1:1-16; 10:7-15; 1 Cor 9:16; Eph 5:1; Col 1:23; 2 Tim 4:2; 1 Pet 2:21",

    "content": "Encounters with Jesus\nJesus’ dramatic miracles and intriguing parables can overshadow his transformative encounters with individuals. In these encounters Jesus deals with people where they are and as they are. He invites people of all backgrounds, personalities, and commitments to embrace him as master and friend, to become his followers and ambassadors of his eternal Kingdom. But Jesus’ invitation to follow always comes with a choice, because the power and wealth of this world is often too heavy and distracting to carry into Kingdom service. To follow Jesus, those who encounter him usually have to abandon something and leave it behind. Those who cannot give up what this world offers are often forced to turn away from Jesus. The same choice faces all who encounter Jesus in the Gospels and hear his invitation to follow.\nAndrew was a fisherman in Galilee, but he longed for the Messiah and his Kingdom. He followed John the Baptist until John pointed to Jesus. Then Andrew not only followed Jesus, but called others, including Peter, to come too. See John 1:29-42\nSimeon and Anna had long waited to see the promised Messiah. When they saw the infant Jesus, they recognized him as the Messiah, blessed him, and praised God for his coming and the hope he brought. See Luke 2:25-38\nNathanael responded skeptically when he was first invited to meet Jesus, but when Jesus demonstrated that he already knew him, Nathanael’s response dramatically changed, and he followed Jesus without hesitation. See John 1:43-51\nA rich man came to Jesus and asked what he should do to inherit eternal life. This man demonstrated humility and was careful to obey all God’s laws. Jesus loved this man but told him that he still needed to sell all his possessions, give to the poor, and follow him. The man was unwilling to abandon his wealth and in sadness walked away from Jesus. See Mark 10:17-22\nMatthew had turned from his Jewish heritage, become a traitor to his people by collecting Roman taxes, and chosen a lifestyle of wealthy indulgence. When Jesus called him, Matthew left his old life and followed. Before joining Jesus in his travels, Matthew invited his friends to meet Jesus. See Matthew 9:9-13\nThomas doubted the other disciples’ claim that Jesus had come back to life. When Jesus finally appeared to Thomas, he singled Thomas out and asked him to touch his wounded, resurrected body. Thomas immediately bowed before Jesus and confessed what he believed—that Jesus was his Lord and God. See John 20:19-29\nMartha was working hard to prepare a meal for Jesus in her home and became upset that her sister Mary was sitting and learning at Jesus’ feet. Jesus gently encouraged Martha not to be angry and pointed out that Mary had chosen best by stopping to listen. On a later occasion, Jesus confronted Martha to affirm faith in him for eternal life. See Luke 10:38-42; John 11:17-27\nA Roman officer asked Jesus to save his dying slave but excused Jesus from coming to his unclean Gentile home, because he believed Jesus could heal his slave from where he stood. Jesus honored this Roman’s faith by doing just that. Jesus also affirmed that many Gentiles would be welcomed by faith into the Kingdom of Heaven. See Matthew 8:5-13\nA woman caught in adultery was brought by Jewish leaders to Jesus for judgment. Stoning was the expected punishment, but Jesus, writing in the dust, asked any accuser without sin to throw the first stone. When they all walked away, Jesus told the woman to go and sin no more. See John 8:1-11\nNicodemus, a leading Pharisee, was cautious about being seen with Jesus, so he came to him at night. Jesus engaged Nicodemus and challenged his assumptions about spiritual truth. Nicodemus later defended Jesus in the Council. After the crucifixion, he helped to bury Jesus, revealing his commitment. See John 3:1-21; 7:50-52; 19:38-42\nJames and John believed God’s Kingdom was at hand, and they requested places of honor, angering the other disciples. Jesus gently explained that true leadership is demonstrated through service, not wealth or power. The disciples would all learn this through hard experience.  See Mark 10:35-45; John 13:1-17\nThe people of Nazareth had known Jesus as Joseph’s son and couldn’t believe he could be the Messiah. Their doubt greatly limited Jesus’ miracles among them, and their anger at his claims forced him to leave. See Luke 4:14-30\nThe religious leaders knew and obeyed external laws down to fine detail but failed to show love in more important ways. Over and over again, Jesus confronted them for this, but most of these leaders rejected Jesus’ criticism and looked for ways to destroy him. See Luke 11:37-54; cp. Acts 6:8–8:1; 9:1-31 \nZacchaeus collected taxes for Rome, becoming wealthy at his people’s expense. He was curious about Jesus and climbed a tree to see him over the crowd. Jesus singled him out, went to his house, and called Zacchaeus to a new life. Zacchaeus repented of his ways and paid back everyone he had wronged. See Luke 19:1-10\nTwo followers of Jesus were returning home to Emmaus after Jesus’ death. Along the way, the resurrected Jesus joined them and explained from Scripture why he had died. They didn’t recognize Jesus until he broke bread with them, after which Jesus disappeared. The two joyfully went to tell the disciples that Jesus was alive. See Luke 24:13-35\nA Samaritan woman of ill-repute went to Jacob’s well to draw water and found Jesus there. Jesus offered her living water and a new life. She was surprised but responded in faith and called others to meet the Messiah they longed for. See John 4:1-42\nPilate was pressured by the Jewish leaders to execute Jesus. He believed Jesus was innocent and sought to free him. Pilate asked Jesus, “What is truth?” but did not realize that Jesus himself was the Truth. In the end, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified to keep the peace. See John 18:28–19:16\nSimon Peter denied three times that he even knew Jesus. After his resurrection, Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved him. Each time, Peter reaffirmed his love, and Jesus told him to feed his sheep. Thus, Jesus restored Peter. See John 21:1-23; see also Matt 16:15-19\nPassages for Further Study\nMatthew 8:5-13; 9:9-13; 16:15-19; Mark 10:17-22, 35-45; Luke 2:25-38; 4:14-30; 10:38-42; 11:37-54; 19:1-10; 24:13-35; John 1:29-42, 43-51; 3:1-21; 4:1-42; 7:50-52; 8:1-11; 11:17-27; 13:1-17; 18:28–19:16; 19:38-42; 20:19-29; 21:1-23",

    "content": "The Day Is Coming\nJesus predicted three future events in the synoptic Gospels. One was his own death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34); this was a past event when the Gospels were written.\nThe second event that Jesus predicted was the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 (Matt 24:1-28; 13:1-23; Luke 19:41-44; 21:5-24). This event was probably about to happen when Mark wrote his Gospel (see Mark Book Introduction, “Date”). It would not signify the very end, so the Christian community must continue to live in faithful watchfulness after this event for the Son of God’s return in glory, which might be soon (Mark 13:34-37).\nThe third event that Jesus predicted was his own future return (Matt 23:39; 24:3, 29-31, 24:36–25:46; Mark 8:38; 13:24-27, 32-37; Luke 21:25-36; John 14:1-3). References to Jesus’ return can be found throughout the New Testament (see, e.g., 1 Cor 1:7-8; 3:13; 5:5; 2 Cor 1:14; Phil 1:6, 10; 2:16; 1 Thes 5:1-11; 2 Thes 2:2; 2 Tim 1:12, 18; 4:1, 8).\nWhen Jesus returns, the promises about God’s Kingdom will be completely fulfilled. Jesus will bring judgment and destruction for Satan and his angels (Rom 16:20; 2 Thes 2:3-12). Unbelievers will also experience eternal judgment (Matt 13:40-42; 25:31-46; Luke 6:24-26; 16:19-31; Acts 10:42; Eph 5:6; Col 3:6; Heb 10:25; 2 Pet 3:7; Jude 1:6; Rev 1:7; 6:14, 17). Meanwhile, the faithful will be resurrected to experience the joy of eternal life (1 Thes 4:13-18). God will gather his chosen people for salvation (Mark 13:27; Heb 1:14; 9:27-28), grace (1 Pet 1:13), and glory (1 Thes 2:12; 2 Thes 2:14; 1 Pet 1:7; 5:1, 4). He will give his people a priceless inheritance (1 Pet 1:4) and new eternal bodies (1 Cor 15:35-57; Phil 3:21; 1 Thes 4:13-18). All of creation will also be rescued from its curse (Gen 3:17-18) and be transformed (Rom 8:20-23; 2 Pet 3:12-13; Rev 21:1–22:5). Sorrow, tears, mourning, and death will no longer exist (Rev 21:4). Those who have had faith during this life will see God (Matt 5:8; Rev 22:3).\nIn light of these promises, believers in Jesus are to prayerfully await his return (Matt 6:10; Rev 22:20). We should not speculate on dates for his coming (Mark 13:32; Acts 1:7), but should live in a way that is honorable (1 Jn 2:28) and be prepared (Matt 24:36–25:30; 1 Thes 5:1-11).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 5:8; 6:10; 13:41-42; 23:39; 24:3–25:46; Mark 8:38; 13:1-37; 14:25; Luke 6:24-26; 16:19-31; 19:41-44; 21:5-36; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:6-7; 10:42; Rom 8:20-23; 16:20; 1 Cor 1:7-8; 15:35-58; 2 Cor 1:14; Phil 1:6, 10; 2:16; 3:21; 1 Thes 4:13-18; 2 Thes 2:2-14; 2 Tim 4:1-8; Titus 2:11-13; Heb 9:28; 10:25, 37; 1 Pet 1:7, 13; 5:1-4; 2 Pet 3:7-13; 1 Jn 2:28; Rev 1:7; 6:15-17; 21:1–22:7; 22:12, 20",

    "content": "Jesus’ Final Night\nWhen Jesus went into Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover, he knew it was his final night. He had come to Jerusalem to “suffer many terrible things and . . . be killed” (Mark 8:31). His disciples had prepared the meal, but he needed to prepare them for what was coming.\nSo Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples. At this meal, Jesus demonstrated true servanthood by washing his disciples’ feet (John 13:1-20). He gave his final teachings to the disciples, informed them about the coming of the Holy Spirit, and prayed for his followers (John 14:1–17:26). Jesus also established the new covenant (Mark 14:22-24). Jesus was now the Passover Lamb—his body and blood are now the sacrifice that saves his people from judgment, fulfilling the same purpose as the lamb at the first Passover.\nIt was on Passover that God had struck down all the firstborn males of Egypt but had spared those of Israel. Now Jesus would be struck down so that his people could be spared—just as the prophets had predicted (e.g., Zech 12:10; 13:7). Jesus warned his disciples that this was about to happen and that they were about to desert him (Mark 14:27). Jesus also warned his disciples that he would be betrayed by one of them (Mark 14:18).\nAfter the meal, Jesus and his disciples walked to the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives, where Jesus prayed in agony, submitting his will to the Father (Mark 14:26-42). Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, then approached with a group of soldiers, who arrested Jesus (Mark 14:43-49). Jesus’ disciples fled (Mark 14:50-52), and Jesus was taken to the house of the high priest for an overnight trial, during which Peter denied Jesus three times (Mark 14:53-72).\nWhile Jesus’ final night was marked by tragedy, nothing that happened was outside of his foreknowledge. Everything occurred according to God’s plan and was necessary in order to fulfill Scripture and to usher in the events which followed (his death and resurrection).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 26:17-56; Mark 14:12-52; Luke 22:7-46; John 13:1–18:11; 1 Cor 11:23-34",

    "content": "Praise and Rejoicing in Luke—Acts\nThroughout Luke’s Gospel, the recipients of God’s grace praise him for his wonderful deeds (Luke 1:44, 46, 64, 68; 2:13, 38; 5:25-26; 7:16; 13:13; 17:15-18; 18:43; 19:37; 24:53). In Acts, praise accompanies healings (3:8-9; 4:21-22) and the salvation of the Gentiles (Acts 11:18; 13:48; 21:19-20).\nThis motif of praise is closely linked to a key theme in Luke, that the fulfillment of God’s promise in the coming of Jesus the Messiah is a cause for joy and rejoicing. This theme emerges toward the beginning of the Gospel in the songs of Mary (Luke 1:46-55) and Zechariah (Luke 1:67-79). The Old Testament prophets had predicted that nature itself would break forth in songs of praise when God’s salvation arrived (see Isa 55:12). When Jesus entered Jerusalem at the end of his ministry, his disciples shouted and sang, “praising God for all the wonderful miracles they had seen” (Luke 19:37). The Pharisees called on Jesus to rebuke his disciples, but he responded, “If they kept quiet, the stones along the road would burst into cheers!” (19:37-40). At the end of the Gospel, the disciples “returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy. And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God” (24:52-53). The arrival of God’s marvelous salvation is a cause for rejoicing and praise.\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 55:12; Luke 1:44-47, 64, 68; 2:13-14, 38; 5:25-26; 7:16; 13:13; 17:15-18; 18:43; 19:37-40; 24:51-53; Acts 2:47; 3:8-9; 4:21; 11:18; 13:48; 21:20",

    "content": "The Birth of Christ\nThe accounts of the birth of Jesus (Matt 1:18–2:12; Luke 2:1-20) are a study in contrasts. On the one side is the lowliness of the birth. A poor peasant couple makes their way to their ancestral home of Bethlehem to register for a census imposed on them by the oppressive Roman Empire. Their journey is a long and hard one from Galilee, and when they arrive they can find no place of lodging. They are consigned to a place reserved for animals. There is a sense of poverty, rejection, and obscurity. At the birth of the child, announcements are sent not to great kings or to the rich and powerful, but to lowly shepherds watching their flocks in a field.\nYet beside this humble lowliness is a message of unspeakable power and grandeur. The child who is laid in a manger is the Messiah, the long-awaited descendant of King David. He will reign triumphant over the people of Israel and his kingdom will never end. He is the one spoken about by all the prophets. All of history has been pointing forward to its climax in him. A group of wise men from the East come to pay homage to him. And an army of mighty angels comes from heaven to announce his birth.\nThese contrasts are a foretaste of things to come. In Jesus, the God of Israel and Lord of all the earth has come to visit and to save his people. The Divine One reaches down to meet them where they are. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus will show special concern for the lowly, the poor, the outcast, and sinners. These are the ones he has come to save because they recognize their need for him. They receive the message of salvation with joy and rejoicing.\nThe contrast between lowliness and exaltation also relates to Jesus’ mission. Though wicked people reject him and put him to death, Jesus is vindicated at his resurrection and exalted to the right hand of God, where he reigns as Lord and Messiah. From there he pours out the Spirit of God to guide and direct his church. Through his life, death, resurrection, and exaltation, Jesus provides forgiveness of sins and eternal life to all those who respond in faith to him.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 1:18–2:12; Luke 2:1-20",

    "content": "Hope for the Messiah\nIn the first century, many Jews eagerly looked for the coming of the Messiah, a deliverer who would defeat Israel’s enemies and usher in an era of peace and prosperity for God’s people.\nThe Hebrew word Messiah is equivalent to the Greek word Christ—both mean “Anointed One.” The term comes from the practice of anointing Israelite kings with oil at their enthronement to confirm their appointment to rule the nation as God’s representative. Thus the term came to refer to the future king that Israel hoped for. There was widespread hope that a king from David’s line would reestablish David’s dynasty and reign in righteousness and justice on David’s throne in Jerusalem. This hope had its foundation in 2 Sam 7:11-16, where God promised King David that he would raise up descendants after him and establish his throne forever. With the decline and subsequent collapse of Israel as a kingdom, the Old Testament prophets predicted the coming of the Messiah (Isa 9:6-7; 11:1-5; Jer 23:5-6; 33:15-16; Ezek 37:24-25), the king who would deliver God’s people and reign forever on David’s throne.\nThe Gospel writers take a special interest in showing that Jesus is truly the promised Messiah (see e.g., Matt 1:21-23; Luke 1:32-33, 69-70), but that he has fulfilled the messianic promises in a surprising way. After Peter confessed that Jesus is “the Messiah sent from God,” Jesus immediately began teaching about the Messiah’s suffering (Luke 9:20-22). As Jesus approached Jerusalem for the last time, he was recognized as the King coming in the name of the Lord (Luke 18:36-38; 19:36-38), but then he was rejected (Luke 22:66-71) and crucified, mocked as “king of the Jews” and “God’s Messiah” (Luke 23:35-39).\nOn the third day, however, Jesus rose victorious from the dead, just as he predicted. During his appearances to the disciples he revealed that the Scriptures predicted all along that “the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his glory” (24:26). Jesus’ death and resurrection confirm that he is truly the Messiah and that his death brings restoration and forgiveness of sins (24:46-47).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 7:11-16; Isa 9:6-7; 11:1-5; Jer 23:5-6; 33:15-16; Ezek 37:24-25; Luke 2:25-32; 3:15",

    "content": "The Suffering Prophet\nJesus is described by many titles in the Gospels, including Messiah, Son of David, Son of Man, Son of God, and Lord. In Luke, a key title is “Prophet.” Jesus was the prophet that Moses predicted in Deut 18:15.\nAs a prophet, Jesus preached God’s word and performed miracles like those of the great Old Testament prophets. When Jesus raised a widow’s son, the people cried out, “A mighty prophet has risen among us” (Luke 7:16). The disiples reported to Jesus that people were identifying him as a prophet (Matt 16:13-14). And the disciples on the Emmaus road identified him as “a prophet who did powerful miracles” and “a mighty teacher” (Luke 24:19).\nLike other prophets, Jesus suffered for his testimony (cp. 1 Kgs 19:1-18; Jer 11:18-19; 18:18; 20:1-2, 7-18; 26:7-11, 20-23; 38:1-6). While the people linked Jesus’ prophetic office to his miracles and teaching, Jesus connected it especially to his suffering. At Nazareth, he affirmed that “no prophet is accepted in his own hometown” (Luke 4:24), and he later accused Israel’s leaders of murdering their prophets (11:47-51). As he journeyed to Jerusalem, he exclaimed, “It wouldn’t do for a prophet of God to be killed except in Jerusalem!” (13:33).\nIn the Old Testament, when Israel did not heed God’s prophets, divine judgment followed. Similarly, God’s people would face judgment if they did not listen to Jesus (see Acts 3:22-23).\nJust as the revelation that Jesus is the Messiah confirms that he is the Savior for all people, so his role as prophet confirms that his message comes from God, and his words are the authentic word of God, which must be heard and obeyed.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 18:15; Matt 5:12; 23:34-37; Luke 4:22-24; 6:23, 26; 7:16; 11:47-52; 13:33-34; 24:17-21; Acts 3:22-23; 7:37, 52",

    "content": "Jesus’ Prayers\nIn Luke’s Gospel, Jesus prayed at critical events in his life: at his baptism (3:21), before calling the Twelve (6:12), at the Transfiguration (9:28-29), for Peter before his denial (22:32), and for his murderers from the cross (23:34). At times, Jesus withdrew from others so that he could pray alone (Matt 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16). He also taught the disciples to pray (Luke 11:1-4; see also Matt 6:5-13) and told parables about the need for persistent prayer (Luke 11:5-13; 18:1-8).\nJesus’ prayers are part of Luke’s emphasis on the intimacy between the Father and the Son. Jesus lived in communion with the Father, followed the Father’s purpose, and remained faithful to the Father’s will. In Gethsemane, Jesus agonized over the suffering that lay ahead, but he prayed, “I want your will to be done, not mine” (Luke 22:42). On the cross, he expressed total dependence on the Father, uttering as his last words, “Father, I entrust my spirit into your hands!” (Luke 23:46). Jesus modeled for us a life of trust and dependence on our heavenly Father.\nJohn records a prayer of Jesus on his final night with the disciples, often referred to as the High Priestly Prayer (John 17:1-26). In this prayer, Jesus intercedes for his followers, praying for their protection, understanding, holiness, and unity.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 6:9-13; Luke 3:21; 6:12; 9:28; 11:1-13; 18:1-8; 22:32, 39-46; 23:34, 46; John 17:1-26",

    "content": "The Messianic Banquet\nThrough his teaching and miracles, Jesus announced that the messianic banquet was about to be served. All may come and feast at the table of salvation in God’s Kingdom.\nJesus described his ministry as a wedding feast, with himself as the groom (Luke 5:33-35) and the Kingdom of God as a great banquet. All were invited, but some refused to come (Luke 14:15-24; see also Matt 8:11-12). Jesus often ate with diverse people, from despised tax collectors to pious Pharisees (5:29-32; 7:36-50; 11:37-41; 14:1-6). Jesus also used imagery of feasting and banquets in his teaching and parables (5:33-35; 12:35-38; 14:7-14, 15-24; 17:7-10; 22:28-30). And he fed vast multitudes with a few loaves and fishes (9:10-17).\nThe Old Testament background to this feasting imagery is Isa 25:6, where God’s final salvation is described as a great feast for all people: “The Lord of Heaven’s Armies will spread a wonderful feast for all the people of the world. It will be a delicious banquet, with clear, well-aged wine and choice meat” (see also Isa 65:13-14).\nJesus’ public ministry marked the invitation to the banquet and its inauguration. Through his death and resurrection, he achieved salvation. All people can now come to God’s banquet table and receive the spiritual blessings of the Kingdom. At the same time, this banquet awaits its final consummation in the future Kingdom, when Jesus’ disciples will “eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom” and “sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel” (Luke 22:30; see also Rev 19:7-9).\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 25:6; 65:13-14; Luke 5:29-35; 6:21; 7:36-50; 9:10-17; 11:37-41; 12:35-40; 13:24-30; 14:1-24; 17:8; 22:30",

    "content": "Rich and Poor in the Gospel of Luke\nThroughout Luke’s Gospel, a reversal of worldly fortunes characterizes entrance into, or exclusion from, the Kingdom of God. Mary announced that God would lift up the poor and humble and bring down the rich and powerful (1:52-53). Jesus announced at Nazareth that the gospel is “Good News to the poor” (4:18). He pronounced blessings on the poor and hungry, and woes against the rich and satisfied (6:20-26). This was a reversal of conventional wisdom, which held that God had blessed the rich and cursed the poor.\nA number of Jesus’ parables severely warn against the danger of riches. The parable of the rich fool (12:13-21) reveals the consequence of storing up treasures on earth instead of having a rich relationship with God. The parable of the rich man and Lazarus (16:19-31) shows the eternal cost of ignoring the poor and helpless while enjoying the good things in life. The rich man who asked Jesus the way to eternal life was devastated when Jesus said he must sell all that he had and give to the poor (18:18-23).\nWho are the poor in Luke’s Gospel? Are they the physically poor or those that are poor in spirit (cp. Matt 5:3)? Almost certainly it is both. The physically poor, who have very little, are naturally dependent on God for their needs. The rich and powerful are likely to be self-sufficient, forgetting their need for God. It is impossible for rich people to enter God’s Kingdom as long as they trust in their riches to get them there (16:25-26). God accepts those who put their faith in him alone.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 5:3; Luke 1:52-53; 4:18; 6:20-25; 12:13-34; 14:12-23; 16:19-31; 18:18-30",

    "content": "The Climax of Scripture\nThe account of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus is significant not only as a resurrection appearance—and so as proof of Jesus’ victory over death—but also as a key moment of revelation concerning the role of the Messiah and the Old Testament prophecies about him.\nThe two disciples pointed out to their anonymous traveling companion that this man named Jesus had shown himself to be a great prophet through his teaching and miracles. But they had hoped that he might be even more—the Messiah! Their hopes were shattered, however, when he was arrested and crucified.\nJesus responded by rebuking them for not reading the Scriptures attentively enough. The suffering of the Messiah was predicted all along in Scripture. Luke then relates how Jesus took the two disciples on a tour of Scripture, explaining to them “from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself” (Luke 24:27).\nAlthough Jesus does not specify which Old Testament passages speak of the suffering Messiah, various texts are cited elsewhere. Jesus is the rejected stone that becomes the cornerstone, the foundation for a new temple of God (Ps 118:22, cited in Luke 20:17); the suffering Servant of the Lord, who is treated like a common criminal (Isa 53:12, cited in Luke 22:37) and who is mocked, insulted and spit upon by his opponents (Isa 50:6, alluded to in Luke 18:32); the anointed king rejected by rulers and the people of Israel, but vindicated by God (Ps 2:1–2, cited in Acts 4:25–28); the descendant of David who will not be abandoned to the grave by God (Ps 16:8–11, cited in Acts 2:25–28).\nAccording to Luke 24:27, Jesus surveyed the whole story of Israel’s history and showed how it all leads to and climaxes in the coming of Jesus the Messiah, God’s agent of salvation. This is similar to how Paul describes Christ as having “accomplished the purpose for which the law was given” (Rom 10:4). All the Old Testament Scriptures—including the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms (Luke 24:44)—point to God’s story of salvation, which reaches its climax and ultimate purpose in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.\nPassages for Further Study\nLuke 24:13-49; Rom 10:4",

    "content": "The Coming of the Spirit of God\nIn the Old Testament, the Spirit of God occasionally came upon individuals to empower them for God’s service and to prophesy (Num 24:2; Judg 3:10; 1 Sam 10:10; 16:13; Ezek 11:5). In the Judaism of Jesus’ day, there was a widespread belief that the Spirit of prophecy had departed from Israel with the last of the Old Testament prophets. But the prophets had predicted that when God’s salvation arrived, he would pour out his Spirit on all people (Isa 32:15; Ezek 36:26-27; Joel 2:28-32).\nThis prophecy finds its initial fulfillment in the birth narrative in Luke. The Holy Spirit inspired prophetic witness and guided the events of Jesus’ birth. John the Baptist was filled with the Spirit even before he was born (Luke 1:15, 41), and Zechariah broke forth in a Spirit-filled hymn of praise to God (1:67). Mary conceived Jesus and prophesied through the power of the Spirit (1:35; 1:46-55), and Simeon was led by the Spirit to the Temple to see the Messiah (2:25-27). Later in his life, Jesus was anointed by the Spirit at his baptism and empowered to accomplish his role as the Messiah (3:21-22; 4:1, 18).\nFollowing his ascension, Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies by pouring out his Spirit on his disciples on the Day of Pentecost, empowering them to take the Good News of salvation to the ends of the earth (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8; 2:4, 17-18). Throughout Acts, the church accomplished its mission through the guidance, power, and direction of the Holy Spirit. The coming of the Spirit marks the beginning of God’s salvation—God’s presence and power now reside with his people.\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 24:2; Judg 3:10; 1 Sam 10:10; 16:13; Isa 32:15; Ezek 11:5; 36:26-27; Joel 2:28-32; Luke 1:15, 35, 41, 67; 2:24-27; 3:22; 4:1, 18; 24:49; Acts 2:4, 17-18",

Both Greek and Jewish listeners in the first century would immediately recognize the profound meaning of this title. Greeks would have thought of the seminal forces that sustain the universe. Jewish minds would have thought back to God creating the world with his word (Gen 1:3-28; Ps 33:6, 9). In Jesus’ day, the Word of God had taken on creative personal attributes. Jews viewed God’s Word as personifying divine Wisdom. Through Wisdom, God extended himself into the cosmos, creating the world (Prov 8:22-31).\nJohn makes it clear that Jesus shares the same essence as God; the Son existed before time, and he was the agent of all creation. John anchors the divinity of Jesus in this ancient Jewish concept of Wisdom. The divine Wisdom that has existed with God from before time can now be known in Jesus Christ. In perhaps the most striking verse penned by an apostle, John writes that this Logos, this Wisdom, became flesh and lived among us as a human (John 1:14). What God is, the Logos is, and the Logos is Jesus Christ.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:3-28; Ps 33:6, 9; Prov 8:22-31; Isa 40:8; John 1:1-18; 1 Jn 1:1; Rev 19:13",

    "content": "Miraculous Signs in the Gospel of John\nThe Gospels use three words to describe Jesus’ miraculous works. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Greek word dunamis (“power”) describes an act of raw force that amazes observers and leads to the inevitable conclusion that God must be at work in Jesus (see Mark 6:2).\nJohn, however, does not use the popular term dunamis in relation to Jesus’ miracles. Instead, he labels each of Jesus’ miracles as a “sign” (Greek sēmeion), an event that has a deeper meaning. John also describes Jesus’ miracles as “works” (Greek erga, see John 10:38; see also 7:3, translated “miracles”; 9:3, translated “power”). Christ’s miracles were part of the work that God gave him to do (17:4), revealing the Father to the world.\nJohn selectively records seven miraculous signs that occurred during Jesus’ ministry: (1) changing water to wine (2:1-11); (2) healing an official’s son (4:46-54); (3) healing a paralyzed man (5:1-17); (4) feeding five thousand (6:1-15); (5) walking on water (6:16-21); (6) healing a blind man (9:1-41); and (7) raising Lazarus from the dead (11:1-44). John also records a miraculous catch of fish after Jesus’ resurrection (21:4-14). Most of the seven signs were met with belief (2:11; 4:53; 11:45-48). However, Jesus’ purposes extended beyond the signs themselves. The miraculous signs are like physical roadsigns: They are messages that point to a greater reality. Thus, a miraculous sign is usually accompanied by a discourse from Jesus in which he explains the truth that the sign points to. For example, Jesus fed the five thousand not just to meet their needs but also so that people would see him as the bread of life (6:35), given for them when he died on the cross (6:51).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 4:8-31; 7:3; Num 14:11, 22; Deut 4:34; Pss 74:9; 78:43; Matt 12:38-39; John 2:1-11, 18, 23; 3:2; 4:48, 54; 6:2, 14, 26, 30; 7:31; 9:16; 10:41; 11:47; 12:18, 37; 15:24; 20:30; Acts 2:43; 4:16, 22, 30; 5:12; 8:6; 14:3; 15:12; Rom 15:19",

    "content": "“Belief” in the Gospel of John\nBelieving occupies a central place in John’s Gospel. John does not use the noun faith that appears frequently elsewhere in the New Testament (e.g., see Matt 8:8-10; Mark 11:22; Acts 20:21; Rom 1:17; 3:27-31; 4:3-5; Heb 11:1-39; Jas 2:14-24; 1 Pet 1:5-7). John prefers the verb believe to underscore that faith is not simply a static dogma, but is dynamic, requiring action. In John’s Gospel, “believing” in Jesus is the trait of all true disciples.\nIn the Gospel of John, the verb translated “believe” is often followed by the Greek preposition eis (“into”). No parallel exists for this combination in ancient Greek usage. For John, faith is not a status, but an investment in the person of Jesus. Faith means accepting who Jesus is and what he claims to be. Faith constitutes a commitment to let his call change the way we live. Faith is the work God wants from us (John 6:29), demonstrated as we abide in Jesus’ word, as we love him, and as we obey his commands (John 8:31; 15:1-17; see 1 Jn 5:10).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 15:6; Isa 28:16; Mark 1:15; 9:23-24; John 1:12-13; 3:10-18; 5:24; 6:35-36; 7:38; 9:35-38; 11:25-27; 12:37; 20:25-31; Acts 10:43; 13:39; Rom 1:16; 10:9-10; Heb 4:3",

    "content": "Living Water\nIn Israel, a land that frequently experienced drought, people were keenly aware of water sources and water quality. Springs and rivers that ran all year were few, so the people relied on cisterns to catch and store the winter rains and wells to tap underground water tables. In Jewish culture, “dead water” referred to standing or stored water. “Living water” referred to moving water, as in rivers, springs, and rainfall. Such water was precious because it was fresh. And because it came directly from God, it was used for ritual washings (see Lev 14:5-6, 50-51; 15:13; Num 19:17-19).\nThe distinction between “dead” and “living” water helps explain why the woman of Samaria was so perplexed when Jesus offered her living water (John 4:12). Samaria has no permanent river. If Jacob had to dig a well there, how could Jesus offer superior water?\nJesus mentioned living water again in Jerusalem at the autumn Festival of Shelters (7:37-39). This festival, which fell during a dry time of year, included an emphasis on water. In this setting, Jesus stepped forward and made an extravagant claim: Anyone looking for living water should come to him and drink. Jesus is the source of living water; he came directly from God and brought divine renewal through the Spirit.\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 14:5-6, 50-51; 15:13; Num 19:17-19; Song 4:15; Jer 2:13; 17:13; John 4:10-14; 7:38-39; Jas 3:11-12",

They were divided over the question of Jesus’ identity. When they perceived what he was really saying, some wanted to arrest him while others wanted to become his followers (7:40-44). Only later, when Jesus’ disciples had received the Spirit, did they really understand his significance (see 16:12-13).\nThe world still lives in darkness and cannot understand the realities of life or of God (1:5, 10). Divine revelation is inaccessible to the world. In fact, when the light of God penetrates the darkness, exposing the ugliness of the world, many people flee deeper into the darkness because they prefer it to the light (3:19-20). Only the transforming power of God’s Spirit can provide understanding and help people see clearly as children of God (3:21; 8:12; 12:35-36, 46).\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 6:8-13; 56:10-11; Matt 13:11-17; John 1:10-11; 3:19-20; John 7:32-36; 9:40-41; 12:40; Rom 1:21; 2 Cor 3:13-18; 4:3-4; 1 Jn 2:9-11; Rev 3:17",

Through them John provides a profile of the mature follower, or “disciple,” of Christ.\nWhat is the profile of a disciple? (1) Disciples know who Jesus is. In each of these three accounts, Jesus is identified correctly (see, e.g., 1:34, 36, 38, 41; 4:19, 29, 31; 9:2, 17, 35-38). (2) Disciples believe in Jesus. They see Jesus’ mighty works, listen to his profound words, and believe (see 1:49; 4:39-42; 9:35-38; see also 20:8, 24-29). (3) Jesus’ disciples understand that they must follow him if their discipleship is to be successful (1:37-43; 8:12; 10:4-5, 27; 12:26; 21:19-22). Following implies genuine devotion, leaving what we have to embrace the journey with Jesus.\nJohn provided this profile of true discipleship because he wanted his readers to join these courageous men and women and become disciples of Jesus as well (see 20:30-31).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 9:9-10; 10:16-22; 16:24-28; Luke 14:26-33; John 8:31-32; 9:1-41; 12:25-26; 13:35; 18:36; Acts 9:2; Rom 15:5; 1 Cor 3:4-11",

    "content": "Our Advocate\nOn four occasions in the Gospel of John, the unusual Greek word paraklētos (“called alongside,” “advocate”) is used to describe the Holy Spirit (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7). This term occurs elsewhere in Greek literature, where it refers to a legal advocate—someone who speaks in a person’s defense and provides legal counsel. “Counselor” is a popular translation of this term, but the therapeutic connotations of this word in contemporary English are misleading; the older legal meaning of a lawyer providing advice or counsel is closer to the mark. “Comforter” is another popular translation, but this can also be misleading; the older English meaning of someone who strengthens (an “encourager”) is more accurate to the New Testament concept of paraklētos.\nJesus described the Spirit as another Advocate (14:16). Jesus, who is the first advocate (see 1 Jn 2:1), sent a second Advocate, the Holy Spirit. Every task of the Spirit described in John 14–16 is a task Jesus undertook elsewhere in the Gospel. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would come to encourage, instruct, and strengthen his followers. In fact, the Spirit would sustain Jesus’ own presence among his disciples. Five promises about the Spirit each indicate a different work that the Spirit does (John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-8, 13-14).\nThe Spirit became available to Jesus’ disciples after his death (see 7:39; 20:22). The Spirit now continues the work of Jesus and his presence in the life of believers (14:16-26).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 2:25; 24:15; 2 Sam 15:12; 1 Kgs 12:6-14; 1 Chr 27:32; Job 16:18-22; Isa 1:26; 9:6; John 14:1–16:15; Gal 3:19-20; 6:13; 1 Tim 2:5; Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24; 1 Jn 2:1",

    "content": " “I Am” Sayings of Jesus\nNumerous times in the Gospel of John, Jesus uses the expression “I am” (rendered in Greek as egō eimi). Sometimes it comes as a simple self-description such as “I am the bread of life.” John has seven of these statements that have “I am” followed by a predicate (6:35; 8:12; 10:9, 11; 11:25; 14:6; 15:1). One thing important to note is that Greek does not require the use of the pronoun “I” (egō) in these sentences. Thus, the presence of the pronoun emphasizes the identity of the speaker. As an example from another Gospel, Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount, “You have heard that it was said . . . but I [egō] say” (see Matt 5:22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44, etc.). The inclusion of the personal pronoun sharpens the contrast between Jesus’ instruction and that of Moses. This remarkable phrase underscores the authority of Jesus.\nAt other times, Jesus’ use of “I am” is grammatically odd, occurring without a predicate. For example, “Before Abraham was even born, I Am” (John 8:58). Before Abraham, Jesus was what? (cp. 8:28, 59; 13:19). The best explanation of this odd expression comes from the Old Testament. When Moses met the Lord on Mount Sinai, he was eager to discover God’s name (Exod 3:6, 13-14). God tells him that his name is Yhwh, four Hebrew letters that express existence. When the Old Testament was later translated into Greek, this name for God was translated as “egō eimi”—emphatic “I Am.” The Greek Old Testament continued to use this title (see Isa 43:25; 51:12; 52:6). Any Jewish reader who knew the Old Testament would understand what Jesus meant when he employed the divine “I Am.”\nJesus not only represents God. The “I Am” statements demonstrate Jesus’ divine status and showing that he can work, speak, and act in the Father’s stead. He is no mere man. He is the Word of God dwelling in human flesh. His voice is the voice of the Father, and his life is the life of God made visible in human form. The use of the expression “I Am” is thus a striking and powerful way to express who Jesus is.\nPassages for Further Study\nJohn 6:35, 48; 8:12, 58; 9:510:7-14; 11:25; 14:6; 15:1, 5",

    "content": "Remaining in Christ\nThe Greek term menō, often translated “remain,” “stay,” or “abide,” occurs frequently in relation to Jesus’ descriptions of profound, intimate, and enduring relationships. For example, Jesus said, “You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to [menō en, ‘stay in’] my teachings” (John 8:31). The idea is that a disciple’s life is fully formed by Jesus’ word. Jesus also described how the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son (John 14:10-11). Likewise, when we remain in Christ, the Son is in us and we are in the Father and the Son (17:21-23). Both the Father and the Son come and make their home within disciples.\nThis mutual indwelling is precisely what it means that the disciple remains in Christ. We cannot gain the permanence of our relationship by our own effort; this relationship is only made permanent by the gracious initiative of God indwelling our lives through his Spirit. This means commitment on the part of both God and the disciple. The mutual indwelling between God and the believer is not a fleeting or temporary commitment, but an enduring, permanent, and eternal relationship (see 1 Jn 2:14, 17).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 33:11; 34:28; Josh 7:11-12; 1 Sam 16:22; Pss 22:11, 19; 101:7; Dan 1:21; 2:49; Hag 2:5; Luke 15:31; 22:28; John 6:56; 8:31; 15:1-17; Phil 4:1; 1 Jn 2:19, 27-28; 3:24; 2 Jn 1:9; Rev 2:10; 13:10",

    "content": "The World\nOne of the most frequently used words in John is “world” (Greek kosmos). In Greek-speaking Jewish thought, kosmos refers to the heavens and the earth as created by God (Gen 1; see also John 1:3, 10; 17:5, 24). John extends the concept to include the world of humanity (e.g., 1:10; 3:16).\nAlthough it was created as good, the human world is hostile to God (1:10-11; 3:19-20; 12:37-41). It is controlled by a darkness that cannot comprehend the light and, in fact, resists the light (3:19). The world is dead and needs life (6:33, 51), yet it hates the one who can save it (7:7). The world is under the dominion of Satan (12:31), who will one day be judged.\nGod loves the world of humanity, despite its hostility and rebellion against him. Jesus died to take away the sin of the world (1:29; 3:16-17; 1 Jn 2:2). But God’s love for the world he created stands alongside his necessary judgment of the world (John 3:18-21, 36; 5:27-30; 12:47-48). Christ’s followers experience this same tension in their mission. We are called into the world to bring the message of God’s love, but we will experience conflict because the world will be hostile to our message (see 15:18-27; 17:13-26).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 6:11-12; Pss 2:1-6; 9:8; Isa 61:11; 66:16; Matt 5:14; 13:38-40; John 1:9-10; 3:16-19; 7:7; 8:12; 14:17-19; 15:18-19; 16:7-9, 33; John 17:5-26; Acts 17:31; 1 Cor 1:20-28; 3:3; 6:2; 2 Cor 5:19; Eph 2:2; Col 2:20; Jas 4:4; 2 Pet 1:4; 2:20; 1 Jn 2:15-16; 4:3-5",

    "content": "The Cross and Passover\nAt the beginning of John’s Gospel, John the Baptist introduced Jesus by calling him the “Lamb of God” (John 1:29, 36). This phrase might be a reference to the sacrificial lamb that was killed daily in the Temple (Exod 29:38-46) or to the sacrificial lamb of Isaiah 53:7 (cp. Acts 8:32-35; Rev 5:5-14). Both of these sacrifices spoke of rescue and forgiveness from sin.\nHowever, this was not all that John had in mind. John presented Jesus as the Passover lamb whose death marks the central event of the Passover season (see Exod 12:43-47; Luke 22:7; 1 Cor 5:7). In the first century, Jews made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem each spring to celebrate the Passover and to reread the story of the Exodus (see Exod 12–15). When Israel was being rescued from Egypt, the blood of a lamb was sprinkled on the doorposts of each Jewish home in Egypt, an act which saved those inside from death (Exod 12). Jews who came to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover needed to supply a perfect young lamb for sacrifice (the animal could not be diseased or have broken bones).\nJesus used his final Passover meal to show that his sacrificial death would give new meaning to the festival (Mark 14:17-25). At his crucifixion, Jesus’ legs were not broken, as was often done to fulfill a Passover rule (John 19:31-33; see Exod 12:46). Blood ran freely from his wound (John 19:34), showing that his life was being exchanged for others. Just as a lamb died to save the lives of Jewish families at the Passover in Egypt, so too, the death of the Son of God on the cross serves to bring salvation to the world.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 12:1–13:16; 29:38-46; Num 9:1-14; Deut 16:1-8; 2 Kgs 23:21-23; 2 Chr 30:1-27; Ezra 6:19-21; Isa 53:7; Ezek 45:21-22; Matt 26:2, 17-19; Mark 14:17-31; Luke 22:14-30; John 1:29, 36; John 19:17-36; Acts 8:32-35; 12:3-4; 1 Cor 5:7-8; Heb 11:28; Rev 5:5-14",

    "content": "Fishing in Galilee\nJesus’ knowledge of fishing is evident throughout the four Gospels. The fishing trade provided Jesus with raw materials for parables (Matt 7:10; 13:47-51) as well as a job description for his apostles (“to fish for people,” Matt 4:19). In John 21, Jesus uses fishing to reveal himself to his apostles following his resurrection.\nCommercial fishermen in ancient Galilee fished exclusively with nets. Three types of nets were in use:\nThe drag net was the most ancient kind of net. A wall-like net with weights on the bottom and cork floats on the top was first pulled along the coast. Then the lead rope was swept across the sea by boat and pulled back to shore. The drag net pulled in many fish that could not be eaten under Jewish law. The fish were sorted, the good kept, and the bad thrown out. Jesus used the image of the drag net to describe the day of judgment (Matt 13:47-51).\nThe cast net was circular and measured fifteen to twenty feet across. It had lead weights attached to its edges and was tossed into the sea by a lone fisherman. It landed, sank, and caught unwary fish. The fisherman then dove into the water and either pulled the fish out individually or gathered the net and lifted it into the boat. Simon and Andrew were using cast nets when Jesus called them (Matt 4:18-20; Mark 1:16-18).\nThe trammel net, the only type still used today, is a compound net built from three layers of net. The two outer nets are identical and have wide openings while the inner net is finely meshed and loose, flowing easily in and out of the outer nets. The net is spread in the water in a long line, usually at night, and held while other fishermen scare the fish toward it. The fish enter the first outer net easily, push against the fine mesh inner net and then carry the fine net into the second outer net, entangling themselves hopelessly. The net is then hauled ashore, the fish are disentangled and sorted, and the many breaks in the net are repaired. When Jesus called James and John to follow him, they were repairing their trammel nets (Matt 4:18-22; Mark 1:19-20).\n When Jesus instructed Simon to let down his net again after fishing all night, a miraculous catch of fish convicted Simon (Luke 5:1-11). A similar event occurred in John 21:1-11 when Simon Peter returned from a fruitless night and Jesus told him to throw out his net once more. Peter likely grabbed a cast net, which was then filled with so many fish it was difficult to haul in.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 4:19-22; 7:10; 13:47-48; Mark 1:19-20; 6:41; Luke 5:1-7; John 21:1-14",

    "content": "Jesus’ Ascension\nJesus’ ascension into heaven was a final commissioning service for the apostles (Acts 1:6-11; Luke 24:45-53). The ascension marks the beginning of the powerful ministry of the Holy Spirit through the church (Luke 24:49).\nChrist’s ascension to heaven indicates his elevation to ultimate power and authority (Eph 1:19-23; Phil 2:9-11). That Jesus was going to the Father is noted in other places (John 6:62; 13:1-3; 13:31–14:3, 14:28; 16:5-10, 16, 28; 20:17; Eph 4:8-10). It occurred at the last of Jesus’ physical appearances; after this he would remain in heaven until the “final restoration of all things” (Acts 3:21).\nThe ascension reminds believers of Jesus’ promised return (Acts 1:11; see Matt 24:30; Mark 13:26; John 14:3). The witnesses of the ascension went back to Jerusalem with joy and exhilaration, in praise and worship of Christ (Luke 24:52). They were convinced that their Lord would return again, physically and personally (1 Thes 4:16; 2 Thes 1:7-10; 2 Pet 3:10).\nJesus’ ascension anticipates the believer’s own glorious entrance into the presence of God, where Jesus has gone to prepare the way (John 14:1-3; 2 Cor 5:4; Phil 3:21; Heb 6:19-20).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 24:30; Mark 13:26; Luke 24:45-53; John 6:62; 13:1-3; 14:1-4, 27-28; 16:10, 16, 28; 20:17; Acts 1:6-11; 3:20; 7:54-56; 2 Cor 5:4; Eph 1:19-23; 4:8-10; Phil 2:9-11; Heb 6:19-20",

    "content": "The Holy Spirit’s Presence\nThe book of Acts clearly highlights the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Before the coming of the Spirit, Jesus spoke of the Spirit’s influence on his followers (1:8; see John 14:15-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-15). The Spirit’s guidance was clear in the selection of Spirit-filled leaders to care for the needs of the Hellenistic widows (Acts 6:1-7) and in the appointing of Barnabas and Saul for missionary service (13:1-5). When the first church council met to consider the membership of Gentiles in the church, those present followed the Spirit’s direction (15:28). Christian workers such as Stephen and Philip were filled with the Spirit and preached by his power (6:1–8:40), and Paul’s ministry was charged with the Spirit’s energy from the beginning (9:17). In Acts, the growth, development, and expansion of the church took place entirely under the guidance and power of the Spirit (e.g., 2:4, 41-47; 4:31; 5:32; 8:15, 17, 29; 9:31). Because of the prominence of the Spirit’s work in Acts, the book has often been called “the Acts of the Holy Spirit.”\nThe Holy Spirit works in many ways. He gives and restores life (Gen 2:7; Ps 104:24-30; Ezek 37:1-14; Joel 2:28-32; Rom 8:9-11). He calls and commissions workers for the service of Christ (Acts 13:2; 20:28) and guides God’s servants where and when he wants, to do as he desires (8:29; 9:15; 10:19-20; 11:12; 16:6; 1 Cor 2:13; 1 Pet 1:12). He inspired the writing of Scripture (2 Tim 3:16-17; 2 Pet 1:20-21), instructing the church in Christ’s message (John 14:26; 1 Cor 12:3). He bears witness to the power of the Good News in signs and wonders (Acts 14:3; Heb 2:4), and teaches the truths of Scripture to God’s people (Acts 1:16; Heb 9:8; 10:15-17; 1 Pet 1:11-12). He bears witness to Jesus and brings him glory (John 15:26; 16:13-14). He convicts people of their sinfulness and need for the Good News (John 16:8) and warns people against hardening their hearts (Heb 3:7-11, 15). He bestows gifts upon God’s people (1 Cor 12:4-11), and he energizes and equips them to share the Good News, serve the Lord, and work for the Kingdom of God.\nPassages for Further Study\nJohn 14:15-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-15; Acts 1:8, 16; 2:4, 41-47; 4:31; 5:32; 6:1-7; 8:15, 17, 29; 9:15, 17, 31; 10:19-20; 11:12; 13:1-5; 14:3; 15:28; 16:6; 20:28; 1 Cor 2:13; 12:1-11; Eph 1:13-14; 2 Tim 3:16-17; Heb 2:4; 3:7-11, 15; 9:8; 10:15-17; 1 Pet 1:11-12; 2 Pet 1:20-21",

    "content": "Baptism\nBaptism was an important element of the Christian faith from the very beginning (Acts 2:38). The words “baptism” and “baptize” were already used in Judaism to refer to a religious rite for cleansing. The law of Moses established the use of water to cleanse people from ceremonial defilement (Num 19:14-19). Later, Gentile converts to Judaism from pagan religions were admitted to Judaism only after fulfilling certain obligations, which included the study of the Torah, circumcision, and a ritual bath to wash away the impurities of their Gentile background. This ritual cleansing was often done in special baths created for purification, called mikvahs. Mikvahs were located at many synagogues, and the Temple in Jerusalem had a large number of mikvahs, which suggests that those who approached for worship would ritually bathe.\nJohn preached “that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven” (Luke 3:3). John’s baptism was an aspect of his role in preparing people’s hearts to receive the Messiah (Luke 3:4-6), and those who had received his baptism and repented of their sins were those who were prepared for Jesus’ message (Luke 7:29-30).\nAfter his resurrection, Jesus commanded his disciples to baptize new converts (Matt 28:19). Christian baptism is understood as dying and rising with Christ, signifying the death of the old life and the beginning of the new (Rom 6:1-4; Col 2:12) and also signifying a Christian’s spiritual union with Christ (Gal 3:27) and with his church. Baptism thus became the rite of initiation in the Christian community. For this reason, many interpreters see baptism as the Christian equivalent of circumcision, the rite that initiated membership into the nation of Israel under the old covenant (see Col 2:11-12). Whatever the connection with OT circumcision, baptism signifies a changed heart and a clean conscience that come from God’s forgiveness (1 Pet 3:21; cp. Deut 10:16; 30:6; Jer 4:4; Rom 2:28-29; Phil 3:3).\nAs a ritual cleansing, Christian baptism signifies both forgiveness of sins (Acts 2:38; 10:43; 13:38; 26:17-18) and the reception of the Holy Spirit (2:38; 9:17-18; 10:47-48; 11:15-17; 19:5-7; Luke 3:16). Many interpreters see baptism as the outward confirmation of the inward “seal” of the Spirit, whose presence is a “guarantee” of the eternal inheritance that awaits God’s faithful people (2 Cor 1:21-22; Eph 1:13-14; 4:30; Titus 3:5).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 3:6-16; 21:25; 28:19; Mark 1:4-9; 10:38-39; 11:30; 16:16; Luke 3:3-22; 7:29-30; 12:50; 20:4; John 1:25-36; 3:22-23, 26; 4:1-2; 10:40; Acts 1:5, 22; 2:38, 41; 8:12-13, 16-17, 36-38; 9:18; 10:37, 47-48; 11:16; 13:24; 16:15, 33; 18:8, 25; 19:1-7; 22:16; Rom 6:3-4; 1 Cor 1:13-17; 10:2; 12:13; 15:29; Gal 3:27; Eph 4:5; Col 2:12; Heb 6:2; 1 Pet 3:21; 1 Jn 5:6",

    "content": "The Growth of the Church\nThe book of Acts outlines the church’s growth after Pentecost. In the early days there was numerical growth. After Jesus’ ascension, only 120 believers were present at the first prayer meeting seeking divine direction (Acts 1:12-15). After the mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost, the number of Christians increased to about 3,000 (2:41). Many more believed the preaching of Peter and John, and the number grew to about 5,000 (4:4) and continued to rise (5:14; 6:1; 9:31; 21:20).\nThere is also ample evidence of geographical growth (see 1:8; 9:15). The church was not confined to Jerusalem, as the message spread to Lydda, Sharon, and Joppa on the Mediterranean coast (9:32-43). The message of salvation in Christ also moved out from its Jewish base into Samaria (8:4-12), then into Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch (11:19-26). As Peter declared to Cornelius’s household, “God shows no favoritism” (10:34). The message of Good News offers peace with God through Jesus Christ to all people (10:36).\nWith the increase in numbers and the geographical spread of the faith, the Christian communities also experienced spiritual growth in depth and vitality. Acts 2:42-47 vividly depicts this development in the inner life of the church, featuring earnest, united prayer in crises, generous sharing of possessions, courage during persecution, and boldness in witness (4:23-31, 32-37; 5:27-33, 40-42; 16:19-25). Philip’s preaching, the manner of Stephen’s death, and Paul and Silas’s attitude in prison manifested a high standard of spiritual life and maturity (7:59-60; 8:4-40; 16:19-25). Church leaders encouraged and strengthened believers, made them more steadfast in their faith, enabled them to face persecution (14:22; 15:32, 41; 18:23; see 2 Tim 1:8; 2:1-9; 3:12), and lived by the standards they set for others (1 Cor 4:16, 20; Phil 4:9; 1 Thes 1:5-8; 2 Thes 3:9). The church’s sensitive handling of the Gentiles’ inclusion also resulted in significant spiritual (and numerical) growth: “So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew larger every day” (Acts 16:5).\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 1:8, 13-15; 2:41-47; 4:4, 23-37; 5:14, 27-33, 40-42; 6:1; 7:59; 8:4-40; 9:15, 31, 35, 42; 10:34, 36; 11:19-26; 14:22; 15:32, 41; 16:5, 19-25; 18:23; 21:20; 1 Cor 4:16, 20; Phil 4:9; 1 Thes 1:5-8; 2 Thes 3:9; 2 Tim 1:8; 2:1-9; 3:12",

    "content": "Persecution\nPersecution is a common experience of God’s people. God’s servants have often faced hostility and opposition (e.g., Deut 30:7; 1 Kgs 18:13; Neh 4:1-3; Jer 37:11–38:28; Matt 23:34-37; Luke 11:49-51; 1 Thes 2:14-16). Jesus himself dealt with persecution (Luke 4:28-30; John 5:16). At the end of his earthly life, he endured mocking, beating, and a horrible death by crucifixion, and he told his disciples to expect the same kind of treatment (Matt 10:16-25; 24:9; Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17; John 16:2). He prepared his followers for such occasions, telling them that the Holy Spirit would give them the needed courage (Luke 12:11-12; 21:14-15; Acts 1:8).\nThe book of Acts documents the persecution of the earliest Christians, beginning with the hostility of the Jewish high council and the attacks of Saul of Tarsus on the early church prior to his encounter with Jesus near Damascus (Acts 8:1-3; 9:1-13, 21; 22:4; 26:9-11; see 1 Cor 15:9; Gal 1:13; Phil 3:6). Peter, John, Stephen, James, Paul, and Barnabas all suffered persecution (Acts 4:15-18; 5:17-18; 7:54-60; 12:1-4; 14:5-6). Jesus, in his parable of the farmer and the seed, noted the withering effects of persecution on those with shallow faith (Matt 13:20-21; Mark 4:16-17). Persecution purifies God’s people and gives them the opportunity to conform more closely to the character of Jesus. The apostles’ experiences in Acts bear out Paul’s general statement: “Everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution” (2 Tim 3:12; see Mark 10:29-30).\nJesus told his disciples to expect to defend their faith in hostile settings (Matt 10:18-20; Luke 21:12-15), and the apostles and other leaders did so with courage and boldness (e.g., Acts 4:8-12, 31; 5:29-32; 6:8-10; 8:4-40; 9:27). Christians are called to defend their faith courageously and graciously, explaining their convictions to those who ask questions (Col 4:6; 2 Tim 2:24-25; 1 Pet 3:15).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Kgs 18:2-15; 19:1-18; Neh 4:1-3; Jer 37:1–38:28; Matt 10:16-39; 13:20-21; 23:34-38; 24:9-14; Mark 10:29-31; 13:9-13; Luke 11:47-51; 12:11-12; 21:12-19; John 16:1-4; Acts 4:13-31; 5:17-42; 6:8–8:4; 9:1-31; 12:1-19; 14:1-7; 22:3-29; 23:12-31; 26:9-11; Gal 1:13; 1 Thes 2:14-16; 2 Tim 3:11-14; 1 Pet 3:13-18",

    "content": "Empowering Leadership\nIn Acts 6:1-7 the new Christian community faced a crisis of leadership. The Hellenists, the Greek-speaking Jews in Jerusalem, were upset because the needs of their widows were being overlooked in “the daily distribution of food” (6:1). This disruption threatened the development of the church with “rumblings of discontent” (6:1) and had to be seriously addressed. Wisely, the apostles recognized the problem (6:2-3) and called for the selection of seven men to administer the food program (6:5-6). Many interpreters see these seven as the first deacons (see study note on 6:2-6). A clear division of labor was agreed upon, with the apostles attending to preaching and teaching, and the material needs of the people being handled by other Spirit-filled leaders. The apostles provided empowering leadership by sensitively listening to genuine community needs. This wise handling of the issue, with the united, responsible action of all involved, resulted in spiritual growth and an increased number of believers (6:7).\nDifferent gifts were recognized in the church and put to work for the common good (see 1 Cor 12:4-11; 1 Pet 4:10-11). And every believer has the opportunity to exercise some kind of ministry. This usefulness of every Christian in the service of God is sometimes called the “priesthood of all believers” (1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rev 1:6; 5:10; see Exod 19:6; Isa 61:6; Rev 20:6). Not everyone has the same role, but all have the same calling to use their gifts in God’s service.\nGod has given the church its leaders, not to “lord it over” other people, but to serve the community (Matt 20:25-28; Mark 10:42-45; Luke 22:25-27; 1 Pet 5:1-4). The leaders of the church do well when they recognize both the needs of the community and those whom God has prepared to meet those needs. Good leaders recognize gifted people and help them develop, empowering the members of the body to use their God-given gifts (Eph 4:11-12).\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 19:6; Isa 61:6; Matt 20:25-28; Acts 6:1-7; 1 Cor 12:4-11; Eph 4:11-12; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; 4:10-11; Rev 1:6; 5:10; 20:6",

    "content": "Miracles\nMiracles occur frequently in the biblical narrative. They are particularly concentrated during the time of Moses and during the ministries of Elijah/Elisha, Jesus, and the apostles. The Bible does not attempt to prove miracles, but simply reports them. Miracles demonstrate both the power of God over the natural order and the compassion of God in response to human need. Miracles can lead to belief in God (John 2:23), though they do not necessarily do so and though one must believe in more than the miracle itself (see John 12:37). Miracles remind us of the truth that anything is possible for God (Mark 9:21-23; cp. Matt 19:26; Mark 10:27; Luke 1:37; 18:27).\nJesus performed many miracles during his ministry including physical healings, exorcisms, nature miracles, and raising the dead. Jesus demonstrated a deep love for humankind in the way he responded to people’s needs, and many people followed him in response to his miracles (John 6:2), though he cautioned against following him just because of the miracles (John 6:26). Perhaps the three greatest miracles that occurred in relation to Jesus are (1) his coming as the Word of God in human flesh (John 1:14), (2) his glorious resurrection from the dead (Matt 28; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-53; John 20:1-31; Acts 1:3; 1 Cor 15:3-8; cp Acts 23:6; 26:8), and (3) the miracle of the new birth (John 3:3-8; Gal 2:20; Eph 2:8-10). The coming of Jesus into the world to be the Savior and to die for our sins shows us how much God loves us (John 3:16; Rom 5:8; 8:32; Eph 2:4-5; 1 Jn 3:1-2). The fact that God raised Jesus from the dead reveals God’s power over death and gives us a living hope, the promise of eternal life (1 Pet 1:3-9). And the person who puts faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord is born anew as a child of God and receives eternal life (John 1:12; 3:36; Rom 5:1-2; 1 Jn 5:11-13).\nThe miraculous activity of Jesus continued in the work of his followers, as demonstrated throughout the book of Acts (e.g., Acts 3:1-11; 5:12-15; 6:8; 8:6-7; 9:32-42; 14:3). Filled with the Holy Spirit, the apostles and other Christian leaders performed these miraculous signs, wonders, and mighty works, often in order to offer tangible evidence of the power and truth of the Christian message (14:3; see John 3:2; Heb 2:4).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 19:23-26; 28:1-20; Mark 10:23-27; Luke 1:30-38; 18:24-27; 24:1-53; John 1:12-14; 3:2-8, 16; 20:1–21:25; Acts 4:29-31; 5:12-16; 6:8; 8:4-23; 9:32-42; 14:3-4; 26:8; Rom 5:1, 8; 8:32; Eph 2:4-5, 8-10; Heb 2:4; 1 Pet 1:3-5; 1 Jn 5:12-13",

    "content": "Visions\nVisions are closely related to other revelatory experiences such as dreams (Gen 37:5-10; 40:5-19). Classic examples include Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones (Ezek 37:1-14) and Isaiah’s vision of God’s throne (Isa 6). Visions were often the means by which the Old Testament prophets received messages from the Lord. These visions often contained very striking imagery. The imagery generally offered a graphic, metaphorical depiction of an earthly reality, which was then interpreted for the one seeing the vision by God or an angel.\nVisions are also prominent in the book of Acts, and they are usually connected with prayer (Acts 9:10-12; 16:9-10; 22:17-21; 23:11; see Luke 1:8-20). On one occasion, Cornelius, a Roman officer, was visited by an angel (Acts 10:1-6, 30-32), who told him to send for Peter. The following day, Peter received a vision as he prayed (10:9-16; see 11:5-10) that directly related to his subsequent encounter with Cornelius. In Acts 9, the visions of Paul and Ananias likewise highlight God’s involvement in their lives (9:3-6, 10-16). These visions are not chance coincidences but the providential outworking of God’s saving purposes in the world.\nVisions give divine direction and show Christian workers the way in which they should carry out the Great Commission. Paul had visions on the Damascus road at his conversion (Acts 9:3-6; 22:6-10; 26:12-19), on the threshold of his missionary advance into Europe (16:9), at Corinth (18:9-11), in the Temple (22:17-21), and again in Jerusalem before he set out on his trip to Rome (23:11). Through visions God is active in guiding the affairs of the church and in extending its mission (see the study notes on 10:3, 9-16; 22:17-22; 23:11; see also Gal 1:8-9 and study note there).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 37:5-10; 40:1–41:36; Isa 6:1-13; Jer 14:14; Ezek 37:1-14; Dan 8:1-27; 9:21; Hos 12:10; Obad 1:1; Hab 2:3; Luke 1:8-20; Acts 9:3-6, 10-16; 10:3-6, 9-16, 30-32; 11:5-9; 16:9-10; 18:9-11; 22:6-10, 17-21; 23:11; 26:14-19; 2 Cor 12:1-10; Rev 1:9–22:7",

    "content": "The Good News Message\nThe apostles proclaimed the Good News (or \"gospel\") message in a definite sequence, with the following elements: (1) The Old Testament promises have been fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. (2) God has exalted Jesus by resurrecting him to be the head of the new people of God as the divinely appointed Messiah. (3) The apostles were witnesses of God’s work in Jesus Christ, both as eyewitnesses of his public ministry and resurrection (Acts 2:32; 3:15; 4:33; 5:30-32; 13:30-31) and as his chosen advocates (10:39-43). (4) The proper response to this Good News is repentance and faith (2:38; 3:19; 13:39, 48; 17:30; 20:21; 26:20). (5) The Holy Spirit is promised to those who accept this offer of God’s forgiveness and salvation from sin through Jesus Christ.\nThis basic message was repeatedly preached to both Jews and Gentiles throughout the Mediterranean world (see 1:8; 9:15), including in the words of Peter and Philip recorded in Acts 2:14-41; 3:12-26; 4:8-12; 5:29-32; 8:4-13, 26-40; and 10:34-43. The same themes also characterize Paul’s preaching (e.g., Acts 13:16-49; 1 Cor 15:1-11).\nIt is through this powerful message of God’s saving grace that people’s hearts and minds are turned toward him. And the reception of this message ushers in salvation. All people are summoned to repentance from sin and faith in the saving power of Jesus (Acts 4:12; 13:38; 16:30-31)—through his death we can be “made right in God’s sight” (13:39).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 4:23-24; 24:14; Mark 1:1, 14-15; Luke 4:18-21; Acts 2:14-40; 3:12-26; 8:25-40; Acts 10:34-43; 13:16-41; 16:31; 17:16-31; 20:21; Rom 1:1-5, 15-17; 10:15-17; 16:25-27; 1 Cor 1:18; 15:3-8; 2 Cor 4:3-7; Eph 1:13; 2:4-18; 2 Thes 2:13-14; 2 Tim 1:9-10; 2:8-13; Heb 4:1-16; 1 Pet 1:3-12; Rev 14:6-7",

    "content": "Circumcision in the New Testament\nCircumcision (cutting off the male foreskin) was widely practiced in the ancient Near East (see Jer 9:25-26). For Jews, it had religious significance as the sign of the covenant that God had established with the people of Israel (Gen 17:9-14; Josh 5:2; John 7:22; Acts 7:8; Sirach 44:20). It was normally performed on the eighth day of a male infant’s life (Gen 17:12; Lev 12:3; Luke 1:59; Acts 7:8). The New Testament notes the circumcision of John the Baptist, Jesus, Paul, and Timothy (Luke 1:59; 2:21; Acts 16:2-3; Phil 3:5). Circumcision became a metaphor for the renewal of a person’s relationship with God (Deut 10:16; 30:6; Jer 4:4; Rom 2:28-29). In the late 40s AD, some Jewish Christians tried to require Gentile Christians to undergo circumcision (Acts 15:1, 5; see 21:20-21; Gal 2:4, 11-13), to which Paul and Barnabas objected (Acts 15:2). The ensuing church council at Jerusalem settled the matter in favor of not requiring Gentiles to be circumcised (15:19-21, 28-29).\nPaul insisted that “it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised” (1 Cor 7:19). “What is important is faith expressing itself in love” (Gal 5:6). In Galatians, Paul argued against vigorous Jewish opponents and insisted that everyone enters God’s family simply through faith in Jesus Christ (Gal 2:14-21). Circumcision is not required for acceptance by God (Gal 5:6). The cross of Christ is the way that sinners enter into covenant with God (Gal 2:14-21; Col 2:11-15).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 17:9-14; Lev 12:3; Josh 5:2-9; Jer 9:25-26; Luke 1:59; 2:21; John 7:22-24; Acts 7:8; 15:1-5, 19-21, 28-31; 16:2-3; 21:18-24; Rom 2:25-29; 1 Cor 7:17-19; Gal 2:3-5, 11-21; 5:6; 6:15; Phil 3:5-9; Col 2:11-23",

    "content": "The Unknown God\nWhen Paul spoke to the Areopagus, the “high council of the city” of Athens (Acts 17:19), he was speaking to people who did not share his faith in the God of Abraham and Moses who had revealed himself “many times and in many ways to [his] ancestors through the prophets” (Heb 1:1). The members of his audience had a very different definition of the divine. A host of divinities inhabited their world, and the common people retained much of their belief in the ancient gods. But many of the cultural elite of Athens no longer believed in the gods in any literal sense. Instead, they held to either a form of materialism (the physical is everything) or pantheism (the divine inhabits everything).\nWhat they all shared in common was the absence of the idea that there is one true God who is Lord of all. Their myths told of the activities of various gods, but they did not have faith that the ultimate reality, God himself, could be known. Instead, they reasoned and discussed “the latest ideas,” hoping for a better understanding of the nature of things.\nThere were a wide variety of philosophical ideas current in Athens when Paul visited, but two main schools of thought dominated, Stoicism and Epicureanism (Acts 17:18).\nZeno of Citium (334~262 BC) founded Stoicism. Stoics studied nature’s laws and believed in the Logos, a pervasive organizing and sustaining force that gives all things their essential nature and so gives life and reason to humanity. The good life is one in which reason rules, and peace of mind and harmony with nature prevail. Many prominent statesmen were Stoics or influenced by Stoicism, including Cicero, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. Stoic ideas proved attractive to some Christians because of the similarities between the Stoic logos and the divine Logos (John 1:1-18), and between the idea of natural law and the law of God.\nThose who followed Epicurus (341–270 BC) were empiricists; they relied upon sense experience (as opposed to reason) for knowledge. Epicureans were concerned with natural evidence and were unenthusiastic about mathematics. Their focus was ethics, the study of right behavior; they judged the value of an action or thing in terms of the pleasure or pain it brought. Epicurus saw belief in gods (meddling and powerful beings who terrified ordinary mortals) as a serious threat to tranquility. For him and his followers, neither the gods nor death (which is the end) should be feared.\nWhen Paul spoke in that context, he used their own poets to proclaim things that they could barely comprehend: That the God who made everything is both personal and knowable; that he revealed himself clearly, historically, and definitively in Jesus Christ; that death is not followed by either the cessation of existence or the migration of the soul, but by judgment; and that the proof of all of this is the resurrection of Christ from the dead.\nWhat was foolishness to most of the Greeks of Athens turns out to be the ultimate truth: God is knowable, and can be known through Jesus Christ.\nPassages for Further Study\nPs 50:7-15; Isa 42:5-7; Acts 17:16-32; Rom 1:18-32; Col 1:15-23; 2:6-12; 1 Thes 1:9-10; Heb 1:1-4",

    "content": "The Grace of God\nGrace is a key word in the Bible. It is used to indicate God’s kindness and favor, often in terms of salvation to the undeserving. The New Testament stresses that grace came through Jesus Christ (John 1:14-17). This is not to say that God’s grace was not active in the Old Testament; rather, God’s gracious activity toward humanity reached its culmination through his Son.\nAccording to the book of Acts, God’s great favor was initially experienced in the Jewish community (see Acts 11:19-21; 13:43-49); later, it became clear that God’s grace in Jesus Christ extends to Gentiles as well (Acts 15:8-9; Eph 2:11-18; Titus 2:11). Signs and wonders attested the reality of God’s grace at work among the Gentiles (Acts 14:3).\nPaul proclaimed the Good News “about the wonderful grace of God” (Acts 20:24). Paul never seeks to prove that God is gracious, but he assumes it as a fact when he presents the Good News (see, e.g., Rom 3:24; 5:15-21). Paul rules out any idea that we merit our salvation, because God acts solely by his grace (Rom 4:4-5; Eph 2:4-9). Our good works do not give us right standing with God—if they did, God would be obliged to reward us for our efforts, just as a worker earns a wage (see Rom 11:5-6).\nGod’s grace continues to impact believers throughout their lives—not just in the moment of conversion. Second Peter closes with a command for Christians to “grow in the grace” of Jesus Christ (2 Pet 3:18). Paul encouraged Christians to “continue to rely on the grace of God” as they remained faithful to their Lord (Acts 13:43). And when Paul left the Ephesian elders, he commended them “to God and the message of his grace,” the divine message that was able to build them up and sustain them (Acts 20:32; see 15:40). God’s grace is at the core of the Christian message and the Christian experience, from beginning to end. It is no wonder that the theme of grace is so prevalent in the writings of Jesus’ early followers.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 34:5-7; Num 6:22-27; Ezra 9:8; Pss 30:5; 31:16; Ps 84:11; Isa 60:10; 61:1-3; Hos 14:1-9; Luke 4:18-19; Acts 15:11; 20:24; Rom 5:15-17, 20-21; 12:6; 2 Cor 6:1; 8:9; 12:9; Gal 2:21; 4:10; 5:3-6; Eph 1:3-8; 2:4-10; 2 Tim 1:9; 2:1; Titus 2:11; 3:7; Heb 2:9; 4:16; 13:9; Jas 4:6; 1 Pet 5:5-6, 12; 2 Pet 3:17-18",

    "content": "The Gift of Prophecy\nAs Peter had declared at Pentecost, the gift of prophecy was one of the results of the outpouring of God’s Holy Spirit (Acts 2:17-21; see Joel 2:28-32). The book of Acts names a few Christian prophets (Acts 11:27-28; 13:1; 15:32; 21:9-11; see also The Martyrdom of Polycarp 12:3; 16:2). One of these prophets was Agabus, whose function was similar to that of an Old Testament prophet, performing symbolic acts (Acts 21:10-11; see 1 Kgs 11:29-32; Isa 20:2-6; Jer 13:1-11; Ezek 4:1–5:17) and predicting events to come (Acts 11:28; 21:10-11).\nPhilip the Evangelist was the father of four young women who “had the gift of prophecy” (21:9). The apostle Paul also acknowledged the prophetic gift of some Christian women (1 Cor 11:5). In the Old Testament, most prophets were men, but several women are also described as prophets, for example, Miriam (Exod 15:20), Deborah (Judg 4:4), and Huldah (2 Kgs 22:14-20; 2 Chr 34:22-28). In the New Testament, the gift of prophecy is given to both men and women, and both young and old, as Peter signaled in his sermon at Pentecost (Acts 2:17-18).\nAlthough prophecy sometimes involves foretelling the future (20:22-23; 21:10-11; see Rom 9:24-33; 1 Thes 4:13-17; 2 Thes 2:3-4), at its core prophecy is proclaiming God’s word by preaching, exhorting, and explaining the will of God (Acts 15:32; 19:6; Rom 12:6; 1 Cor 14:3-4, 29-33; Rev 19:10). The gift of prophecy is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians and Ephesians as one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit and of Christ to the church (1 Cor 12:4-11; Eph 4:11-13). It is to be used for the benefit of believers (1 Cor 14:22).\nProphecy is always in need of testing (1 Thes 5:19-21), and the church is strongly warned against false prophets (1 Jn 4:1; see also Rev 2:20-23). When used faithfully and in submission to God’s word and his Spirit, courageous proclamation of God’s truth helps the church to determine what God’s will is and inspires God’s people to do it.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 15:20; Deut 13:1-5; Judg 4:4; 1 Kgs 11:29-32; 2 Kgs 22:14-20; Isa 20:2-6; 44:25; Jer 13:1-11; 23:25-32; Ezek 4:1-17; 13:2-9; Joel 2:28-32; Matt 7:15; 24:24; Acts 2:17-21; 11:27-28; 13:1; 15:32; 19:6; 20:23; Acts 21:9-11; Rom 12:6; 1 Cor 11:5; 12:4-11; 14:1-40; Eph 4:11-13; 1 Thes 5:19-21; 2 Pet 2:1; 1 Jn 4:1-3; Rev 2:20-23; 19:10",

    "content": "Angels\nThroughout the Bible, angels are God’s heavenly agents who carry out his purpose and communicate God’s will to humanity (Gen 16:7-12; Num 22:22-34; Judg 13:3-21; 2 Kgs 1:3, 15; Zech 1:4-12). The only angels named in the Bible are Michael and Gabriel, who carry out special assignments (Dan 8:16, 18; 9:21; 10:12, 21; 12:1-2; Luke 1:19-20; Jude 1:9). Angels had a role in putting God’s law into effect through Moses (Acts 7:30, 35, 38, 53; Gal 3:19). Angels dispense God’s grace and sometimes administer his judgment (2 Kgs 19:35; Acts 12:23; Rev 9:15; 16:1-12). Angels were witnesses of Christ’s life (1 Tim 3:16), and they are now witnesses of the lives of God’s people (see 1 Cor 11:10; 1 Tim 5:21). There are guardian angels who protect God’s people (Matt 18:10; see also Pss 34:7; 91:11; Acts 12:11). They are “spirits sent to care for people who will inherit salvation” (Heb 1:14). Angels will accompany Christ when he returns (Matt 25:31; 2 Thes 1:7-8) and will participate in the final judgment (Matt 13:39, 41, 49-50; 16:27; 24:31; Mark 13:27; Luke 9:26; 12:8; 2 Thes 1:7).\nAngels appear at some significant points in the Gospels. Angels announced the births of John the Baptist and Jesus (Luke 1:1–2:52) and ministered to Jesus after his temptation (Matt 4:11). Angels also appeared at the empty tomb after the resurrection of Jesus (Matt 28:1-8; Mark 16:5-7; Luke 24:23; John 20:12).\nThe ministry of angels is also prominent in the book of Acts. On multiple occasions, an angel of the Lord made possible miraculous escapes from prison (5:19; 12:6-11). An angel offered a message of encouragement to Paul in the midst of a violent storm (27:23-24). An angel also directed Cornelius to seek the Good News from Peter (10:3, 7, 22; 11:13). Meanwhile, an angel struck down Herod Agrippa “because he accepted the people’s worship instead of giving the glory to God” (12:23). Throughout Acts, God was guiding his people in their ministry and using angels to accomplish his purposes.\nSome angels have fallen into sin and are destined for eternal judgment (Matt 25:41; 2 Pet 2:4, 11; Jude 1:6). And although angels are spiritual and heavenly beings, angels are not to be worshiped (Gal 1:8; Col 2:18; Rev 19:10; 22:8-9) because they are inferior to Christ (Heb 1:5-14). Their role is to be servants of God (Heb 1:14).\nPassages for Further Study\nPs 91:11; Dan 8:15-18; 9:21-23; 10:4–11:1; 12:1-2; Zech 1:8-13, 18-19; 2:3-5; Matt 1:20-24; 4:5-7, 11; 13:39-42, 49-50; 18:10; 24:31; 28:2-7; Mark 16:5-7; Luke 1:11-22, 26-38; 2:8-15; 9:26; 12:8; John 20:12-13; Acts 5:19-20; 7:30-35, 53; 10:3-8; 12:6-11, 23; 27:23-24; 1 Cor 11:10; Gal 1:8; 3:19; Col 2:18; 1 Thes 4:16; 1 Tim 3:16; 5:21; Heb 1:5-14; 12:22; 13:2; 2 Pet 2:4, 11; Jude 1:6, 9; Rev 1:1-2; 5:2, 11-12; 7:1-2; 8:3-8; 9:15; 10:7-9; 14:6-10; 16:1-12; 19:10, 17; 20:1; 22:6-9",

    "content": "Natural Revelation\nWhen God speaks to people directly through his word, we call it special revelation. God also speaks to all people indirectly in natural revelation (also called general revelation because it is given generally, i.e., to everyone), through the world of nature he has created. Psalm 19, for example, proclaims that knowledge of God in creation is universal (see Ps 19:1-4).\nSadly, however, a saving response to God is anything but universal. Paul teaches in Romans 1–3 that as a result of Adam’s sin, all people turn away from the knowledge of God that they find in the created world. Apart from God’s grace, natural revelation only condemns people; as Paul states in 1:20, “They have no excuse for not knowing God.”\nGod can still use natural revelation to awaken people to the reality of himself, the one true God. When accompanied and empowered by the grace of God, the beauty and intricacy of the world can stimulate a search for the Creator. Paul appealed to natural revelation in Athens (Acts 17:16-31) as a bridge to preaching the Good News. God’s revelation in the natural world and in human nature can stimulate people to search for him. And then, through the special revelation he has given in Scripture and in his Son, Jesus Christ, people can come to know him and experience his salvation.\nPassages for Further Study\nPs 19:1-4; Acts 14:15-17; 17:24-29; Rom 1:19-21",

    "content": "God’s Unified Plan of Salvation\nGod’s plan of salvation unfolds throughout Scripture, and the continuity of that plan is a central theme in Romans. In 3:21, Paul makes two important points about the new way of being “made right” with God that has been inaugurated in Jesus Christ. First, it does not depend on obeying the laws and regulations of the Old Testament. Second, it was “promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets” (3:21; see also 1:2). God has always planned to save the world through Jesus, and the Old Testament prepared his people for that climactic moment in salvation history. Paul keeps returning to this theme of continuity, especially in chs 9–11, where he shows how God’s dealings with Israel fit into that single, unfolding plan.\nAt the same time, Paul is also concerned to help us understand the discontinuity in God’s single plan of salvation. That plan unfolds in stages. Now that the final stage in Christ has arrived, the prior stage—during which the law of Moses ruled over God’s people—has been left behind. Paul repeatedly emphasizes that our new relationship with God stands separate from the law of Moses (see 6:14; 7:4-6; 10:4). A similar point is made in John 1:17 and Heb 10:1. Paul’s recurring focus in Romans on the nature of God’s plan helps us to put the whole story of the Bible together in a way that honors all parts of his plan.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 1:21-23; Luke 1:46-55, 67-79; Acts 4:10-12; 10:34-43; 13:23-41; Rom 1:3-5, 16-17; 3:21-26; 5:6-11; 8:1-4; 10:5-13; 11:26-27; 1 Cor 15:1-4; Gal 2:14-21; 3:5-14; Eph 1:3-14; Col 1:15-22; 1 Tim 2:3-6; 2 Tim 1:9-10; Heb 9:27-28",

    "content": "The Old Realm and the New\nJews in Paul’s day perceived a contrast between the “present evil age” and a “glorious age to come.” Throughout Romans 5–8, Paul uses these contrasting realms to conceptualize our experience of salvation. The old realm is ruled by death (5:12-21), sin (ch 6), the law (ch 7), and sinful nature (8:1-11). The new realm is characterized by life (ch 5), righteous living (ch 6), grace (ch 6), and the Holy Spirit (ch 8). People’s destinies are directly impacted by the realm to which they belong.\nEach realm is headed by a man who represents its constituents. The old realm of sin and death is headed by Adam, the first man, while the new realm of forgiveness and life is headed by Christ. By nature, all human beings are in the old realm of sin and death and are represented by Adam, the first man—whose sin and death control the destiny of all people (5:12, 18-19). Those who put their faith in God through Christ are transferred by faith into the new realm of life. God appointed Jesus Christ as a “second Adam” (see 5:14). By obeying God and fulfilling God’s will, Jesus won a decisive victory over the realm of sin that Adam had inaugurated (5:18-19). By receiving God’s gift of grace (5:17), people accept Jesus as their head and look forward to eternal life.\nThose who are in the new realm are identified with Christ and enjoy the benefits of union with him. They have “died with Christ,” they have been “buried with Christ,” and their present new life with Christ is an anticipation of the day when they will “live with him” forever (6:3-11).\nPassages for Further Study\nPss 2:1-10; 110:2; 145:13; Dan 2:31-45; 7:1-28; Matt 3:2; 6:10; 7:13; 8:11-12; 12:25-28; 13:44-52; 20:25-28; John 18:36; Rom 5:12–8:39; 14:17; 1 Cor 6:9-11; 15:20-28; Gal 5:16-26; Eph 1:3, 20; 2:6; 5:1-20; Col 1:13-14; Heb 6:4-5; 12:18-29; Rev 11:15; 12:10",

    "content": "The Limitations of Law\nThe law was central to God’s covenant with the people of Israel, and many Jews in Paul’s day (including Jewish Christians) still saw it as critical to how God’s people lived. Therefore, Paul frequently deals with questions about the law, especially in his letters to the Romans and the Galatians. The pinnacle of his treatment comes in Romans 7, where Paul powerfully argues that the law of Moses, rather than having a positive effect on people’s lives, stimulated sin and brought death (see 7:5).\nPaul wants his readers to realize that the law is not at fault, however. God’s law is good and holy (Rom 7:12), but it is powerless to change the human heart. Whether we conclude that Paul (in Romans 7:14-25) is describing the experience of an unbeliever, a mature believer, or an immature believer, the point remains that human sin cannot be overcome by the law. God’s law is given to people who, because of their connection with Adam, are already locked under sin’s power. They may want to do what God tells them, but they find that they cannot. Deliverance can come only through a new and radical experience of God’s power and grace in Jesus Christ (Rom 7:25). Through God’s Spirit, Jesus rescues us from “the power of sin that leads to death” (Rom 8:2).\nIf God’s good and holy law cannot rescue us from our predicament and save us, how much less helpful are all human laws that people rely on for religious or spiritual well-being. Whether those laws come from a religious figure, a tradition we have inherited, or a church we attend, none of them can change the human soul. They can tell us what to do, but they cannot empower us to do it. God’s law can provide guidelines in the new life God has given us by grace, but it can never substitute for the power of God’s grace, made available through the work of Christ.\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 5:1-33; 6:17-25; Josh 24:19-27; Ezra 7:25-26; Pss 1:1-3; 19:7-14; 78:56-59; 119:144; Isa 24:5; 26:4-8; Jer 31:33-34; Hos 4:6; 8:12; Hab 1:4; Matt 5:17-20; 7:12; Mark 7:8-9; Luke 16:16-17; John 1:16-17; 7:19; Acts 13:38-39; Rom 2:13-29; 3:19-21, 27-28; 4:13-16; 7:1-25; 8:3-4, 7; 9:4, 31-32; 10:3-5; Gal 2:16-21; 3:2, 10-13, 17-25; 5:1-4; 1 Tim 1:5-11; Heb 8:7-13; 10:1-18; 1 Jn 3:4-6",

    "content": "The Sovereignty of God\nWe human beings always want to think that we are in charge. We think that by our decisions and actions we can determine what will happen. However, Scripture confronts us with quite a different scenario, pointing again and again to the ultimate sovereignty of God (see, e.g., Deut 4:39; Ps 135:5-7; Isa 46:8-11; Jude 1:24-25). Although human decisions and actions are significant, the will of God is vastly more important (see Jas 4:13-16).\nGod’s sovereign hand is in everything. God is in control of the lives of all people (Ps 135:5-12), the universe, and the course of earth’s history (Isa 40:15-17; Acts 17:24; Col 1:15-20), directing it to his appointed ends (Isa 46:10; Dan 7:27-28; Matt 24:14-31; Rev 1:7-8).\nAs demonstrated throughout 2 Kings, God exercises sovereign power and control over the affairs of nations. He installed and deposed the kings of Israel and Judah according to his purposes and according to the degree of their obedience. He permitted successful attacks against his people as punishment for their sins (2 Kgs 8:18-22). God was in control when the Assyrians attacked Samaria and brought down the northern kingdom (17:1-6, 18, 20). Hezekiah’s successes in Judah were due to the Lord’s blessings (18:5-7). God’s sovereign hand can be seen in all of the complex international events that happened, just as the Lord had promised, during the reigns of the final kings of Judah (23:26-27).\nGod also displays his power in his answers to the prayers and petitions of his people. When Elisha prayed, God responded to his faithful prophet’s requests. Through Elisha he allowed the woman from Shunem to have a son and later brought that son back to life (4:17, 32-35). The Lord graciously answered the prayers of Jehoahaz and provided a rescuer for beleaguered Israel (13:4-5). He honored Hezekiah’s prayers for Jerusalem (19:1-7) and for his own life (20:1-6).\nPaul shows that God determines the course of salvation. Paul constantly explains the unexpected development of salvation history by appealing to what God has said and done. Human decisions alone cannot explain the situation, and God has said that he will show mercy to anyone he chooses (Rom 9:15). While theologians will continue to debate the role of God’s action and the role of human decision in salvation, God’s sovereignty stands out clearly.\nBecause God is sovereign, his people rightly seek to live in harmony with his will (Rom 12:1-2), in the strength that he provides (see 1 Cor 1:8-9). We can follow the example of Christ in his prayer, “I want your will to be done, not mine” (Matt 26:39). The contemporary world has set God to the side and ignores the divine influence on the course of human affairs. But God’s decisions really do direct the world as well as the personal histories of those who trust him. When we live for God’s glory (Isa 42:8; Hab 2:14; Jude 1:24-25), whatever happens is also ultimately for our good (Ps 84:11; Eph 3:16-19; Col 1:27; 2 Thes 1:11-12), and we can confidently affirm that “God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them” (Rom 8:28)..\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 8:22; 9:29; Deut 4:39; 32:8, 39; Josh 2:11; 1 Sam 2:6-8; 2 Kgs 13:4-5; 17:1-6, 18-20; 18:5-7; 19:5-7; 20:4-6; Pss 24:1-2; 84:11; 135:5-12; Isa 40:15-17; 45:7; 46:10; Jer 27:5-7; Dan 7:27-28; Hab 2:14; John 19:11; Acts 17:24-26; Rom 8:28; 9:5-24; 1 Cor 1:8-9; Col 1:15-20; 2 Thes 1:11-12; Jude 1:24-25; Rev 1:7-8",

    "content": "Jews and Gentiles\nOne of the key themes of the New Testament is that God has incorporated Gentiles into the people of God while remaining faithful to his promises to Israel. In Romans 11:11-32, Paul describes God’s plan to save all nations in four distinct stages:\n1. The Good News is proclaimed to the Jews, who respond (mostly) with unbelief. Using the metaphor of an olive tree, Paul says that “some of these branches from Abraham’s tree . . . have been broken off” (11:17). This stage was already a matter of history and personal experience for Paul—although he shared the Good News with Jews in synagogues all over the eastern Mediterranean basin, many Jews rejected the message (see Acts 13:42-49; 18:4-6; 28:23-28).\n2. Many Gentiles respond to the message with faith. As the natural branches were broken off, “branches from a wild olive tree have been grafted in” (Rom 11:17). After being resisted in the synagogues, Paul and the other apostles offered salvation to the Gentiles, and many responded affirmatively (see Acts 13:48-49; 26:15-18). By the time Paul wrote Romans, the church in Rome was largely a Gentile community.\n3. Many Jews respond to the Good News with faith. The natural branches are able to be “grafted in again” (Rom 11:23). Paul argues that the Jews are not “beyond recovery” and are capable of turning to Christ (11:11). Paul’s hope is that, as Gentiles enjoy the blessings of salvation, Jews would become jealous and respond to the Good News (11:11-15).\n4. God pours out great blessing on the world, including the resurrection from the dead. Paul indicates that when the Jews turn to the Lord in greater numbers, it will be a tremendous blessing for the world (11:12, 15). Those who accept God’s offer of salvation—both Jew and Gentile—experience new life (see 11:15) and in the future will experience the resurrection from the dead (see 1 Cor 15:20-26). The end of history will see a great community of both Jews and Gentiles praising God for his mercy. Then all people will see and understand the great wisdom and love of God (Rom 11:33-36).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 7:7-8; 32:19-21; Isa 9:1-3; 49:6; Matt 4:15-16; 8:10-12; 15:21-28; Luke 21:20-24; Acts 2:38-39; 10:45-46; 11:12-18; 13:42-49; 18:4-6; 26:15-18; 28:23-28; Rom 1:5-6, 16-17; 2:9-10, 24-27; 3:9, 29-30; 9:25-33; 10:11-13; 11:11-36; 15:7-13, 27; 1 Cor 12:13; Gal 2:8-21; 3:8-9, 26-29; Eph 2:11-22; 3:6; Col 3:11",

    "content": "Tolerance\nPaul pleads for tolerance between those who are weak in faith and those who are strong in faith, and he teaches that believers need to accept each other (Rom 14:1; 15:7). He instructs them to stop condemning and belittling each other. Rather, they should learn to worship God with a united voice and spirit (Rom 15:6).\nPaul is addressing the specific issue of whether believers need to practice certain requirements of the Old Testament law and of Jewish worship. Theologians have used the Greek word adiaphora (“non-essentials”) to describe beliefs or practices that are neither required nor prohibited by Scripture. On such issues, Christians must accommodate a variety of opinions. And sometimes, believers may feel free to participate in certain activities, but to do so would cause problems for others. In such cases, Paul instructs believers to take into account the needs of others before their own (see 1 Cor 8:1-13).\nPaul takes a very different approach regarding tolerance when the Good News itself is at stake. In Galatians, for example, Paul confronts false teaching about the Good News by severely castigating the false teachers (Gal 1:6-9) and by warning readers that adopting false teaching will alienate them from Christ (Gal 5:4).\nIn our day, we need to be careful about what we tolerate and accommodate, and we need to be equally careful about what we decide is worthy of confrontation. Believers need to consider carefully the different issues they confront in their associations with other believers. If the basic truth of the Good News is not violated, we should not quarrel or be divided over such issues. Other issues, however, strike at the heart of the message of Good News. In these cases, Christians need to take a stand and be faithful to the Good News and to Christ. In some cases, it is challenging to discern whether a particular issue is a central, core issue or whether it is a peripheral matter that is important to discuss but not essential for Christian fellowship. The way Paul himself dealt with a variety of issues in his own time can serve as a guide for dealing with conflicts and controversies in our time.\nPassages for Further Study\nPs 133:1-3; Rom 12:9-21; 14:1–15:13; 1 Cor 1:10; 6:1-20; 8:1-13; 10:1–11:1; 12:12-27; 13:1-8; 2 Cor 6:14–7:1; Col 3:12-15; 2 Tim 2:23-26",

    "content": "Holiness and Sexual Purity\nThe Bible emphasizes the importance of being holy in our sexual relations. God created humanity as sexual beings, and the first command that he gave Adam and Eve was to “be fruitful and multiply” (Gen 1:28). But after sin entered the world, the good that God had created—including sex—became prone to distortion, and the pages of Scripture are filled with examples of sexual sin. God’s people were called to holiness, and the Israelites were given numerous commands that connected sexuality to their holiness (see, e.g., Lev 18:1-30). The sexual purity of God’s people would be seriously tested in the land of Canaan where illicit sexual practice abounded. Over and over again, the Israelites would fail to live up to God’s standards for sexual purity.\nThe believers to whom Paul wrote likewise found themselves living in environments where illicit sexual activity was commonplace. In contrast to the so-called sexual freedom of the Greco-Roman world, the sexual life of God’s people was to be characterized by faithfulness and purity (1 Thes 4:3-8). Sexual relationships are to be restricted to marriage alone (1 Cor 7:1-9, 36-37).\nGod has made Christians holy by the work of his Holy Spirit (1 Cor 6:11; 2 Thes 2:13). They are therefore called to live as his own holy people (1 Cor 1:2). God has given them everything they need to live a holy life in this world (2 Pet 1:3-4). As a result, their way of life is to be distinctly different from that of the unholy world around them. Every part of their life is to reflect the transforming work of the Holy Spirit (Rom 12:2).\nIt is inappropriate for anyone who is united to Christ to have sexual relations with anyone outside of marriage. Such relations violate the Christian’s body, which has become a sanctuary of the living God and therefore belongs to God (1 Cor 6:12-20).\nThough homosexual activity was accepted in Greco-Roman culture, it is condemned throughout the Bible. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, homosexual activity is viewed as a perversion of God’s intentions for men and women (Lev 18:22; 20:13; Rom 1:25-27; 1 Cor 6:9-11; 1 Tim 1:8-11).\nPaul strongly warns that those who freely give themselves to illicit sexual relations, whether homosexual or heterosexual, will not inherit the Kingdom of God but will suffer God’s judgment (1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Col 3:5-6; see also 2 Pet 2:1–3:13). As with all sin, though, forgiveness and cleansing are available for those who turn to Christ with faith and repentance (Acts 2:38; Rom 3:21-26; see 1 Cor 6:11). In every way, God’s people are to live in holiness and godliness (see 2 Pet 3:11-13), in accord with the desires of their Creator and Judge.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 2:18-25; Lev 18:1-30; 20:10-24; Rom 12:1-2; 1 Cor 1:2; 6:9-20; 7:1-9, 14; Gal 5:16-24; Col 3:1-6; 1 Thes 4:3-8; 1 Pet 1:13-16; 2 Pet 1:3-4",

    "content": "Belonging to Christ\nTo many modern readers, the New Testament seems to portray an extreme view of the Christian life. Believers are called to forfeit their rights, suffer, and even die for the sake of Christ (Mark 8:34-36). They are to turn away from the things of the world that everybody else lives for (1 Jn 2:15-17) and even to despise their life in this world (John 12:24-25). Paul encourages believers to give up the normal desires for marriage and family and remain single for Christ, if they have that spiritual gift (1 Cor 7:7).\nWhat lies behind such an apparently extreme view of life? For Paul, it is the awareness that believers are claimed by Christ and so belong to him, body and soul. When Christ died, he bought them for himself (6:20). They must no longer live simply for themselves and their own desires (2 Cor 5:14-15). Having died to their own personal interests, they are called to live entirely for their Lord (Rom 14:7-9).\nFor true Christians, obedience to Christ is not an onerous burden, but a way to express their love and loyalty to the one who died for them. For the people of Christ, the whole of life is to be a joyful expression of thanks for the grace God has shown them in Jesus Christ. They gladly yield their lives to serve the one who gave up everything for them (see 1 Jn 3:16). By dying to themselves, believers make it possible for Christ to live in and through them (Gal 2:19-20).\nPassages for Further Study\nDeut 9:26, 29; 32:9; 1 Kgs 8:53; Pss 2:8; 28:9; Ezek 18:4; Mark 8:34-36; 12:30; Rom 14:7-9; 1 Cor 6:19-20; 7:20-24; 7:32-35; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Gal 2:19-20; 1 Pet 2:9-10",

    "content": "Giving Up Rights\nPaul nowhere tells believers that they should defend their rights. On the contrary, he emphasizes that believers must always be willing to give up their rights for the sake of others. Believers are free from many of the rules that others feel bound by, but they must always be ready to give up their freedoms if their actions would cause someone else to sin (Rom 14:13-23; 1 Cor 8:1-13; 10:23-33). Defending one’s own personal rights is of little value to Paul.\nPaul, like Jesus, sees loving others as one of the most important principles in life (Rom 13:8-10; 1 Cor 13:1-13; Gal 5:6; see Matt 5:43-44; 22:36-39). Real Christian love is always sacrificial (1 Cor 13:4-7), like Christ’s own love. Believers ought never to focus on what is best for themselves, but on what is best for others (1 Cor 10:32-33). The sacrificial death of Christ for sinners is the model that reveals the nature of true love (Rom 5:6-8; 15:1-5; 1 Jn 4:9-12). The whole of a believer’s life is to be an expression of Christ’s sacrificial love. This will never be easy, for it means people must consider themselves dead to their own desires (see Mark 8:34-35).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 5:38-48; 16:24-27; 22:37-39; Rom 5:6-8; 13:8-10; 14:15-22; 15:1-5; 1 Cor 8:1-13; 9:1-23; 10:23-24, 31-33; 13:4-7; Gal 5:6; Phil 2:3-4; 2 Tim 2:9-13; Heb 11:24-26; 1 Jn 4:9-12",

    "content": "The Holy Spirit’s Work\nDifferent New Testament writers emphasized different aspects of the Holy Spirit’s work. John, for example, highlighted the Spirit’s role as teacher and revealer of God’s thoughts and ways (John 14:17, 26; 15:26; 16:13-15; 1 Jn 2:20, 27). Luke focused on the Spirit’s guidance and power for evangelism (Acts 1:8; 4:8-12, 31; 8:29-40; 13:9-12). Paul, meanwhile, provides a comprehensive view of the Spirit’s work.\nAccording to Paul, God gives his Holy Spirit to all who come into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ (1 Cor 6:19; Gal 3:2-5; Eph 1:13-14). The Spirit brings new life in Christ. He affirms believers’ salvation (1 Cor 6:11; 2 Thes 2:13) and their identity as children of God (Rom 8:9, 14-17).\nThe Holy Spirit gives Christians power over sin (Rom 8:1-4), power to live a fruitful life (Gal 5:22-23), and power for ministry (1 Cor 12:1-31). Believers are to be continuously “filled with the Holy Spirit” (Eph 5:18), and though they experience the conflict between the flesh and the Spirit, they can please God by yielding to the Spirit’s guidance and power (Gal 5:16-18).\nThe Holy Spirit enables Christians to understand God’s thoughts and ways (1 Cor 2:9-16). He gives spiritual gifts to believers to help the church grow (12:1-31). The Spirit leads and empowers worship as believers use the gifts that the Spirit has given them (14:26-33, 39-40).\nThe Spirit guarantees that believers will receive all the blessings that God has promised (2 Cor 1:21-22; 5:1-5; Eph 1:13-14). The Spirit helps believers and prays for them in their human weakness (Rom 8:26-27).

    "content": "The Church as a Dynamic Body\nPaul viewed the church as the living body of Christ comprised of believers. Paul made no formal distinction between professional clergy and laity, in which the ministry was done only by the clergy. The community had leaders (see, e.g., 1 Tim 3:1-13), but every believer had a ministry in building up the body (1 Cor 12:12-31). When the early believers gathered together, usually in someone’s home, everyone brought something from God to share with the others (14:26-33).\nPaul understood God’s Spirit as gifting people for their specific ministries (12:7-11, 28; Rom 12:6-8; Eph 4:11) and leading them when they came together for worship. Guided by the Spirit, every believer was to use their spiritual gifts for the benefit of the church. Paul wanted believers to be sensitive to the empowering of the Spirit in all that they did (1 Cor 14:26-33).\nWhen believers meet together, every individual is important and each one has an active role to play. Believers must listen for God speaking his word—and be prepared to speak it—in all their relationships. Paul also calls for the others to “evaluate” what is said (14:26, 29). Every believer is a crucial part of the body, called to be actively involved in its growth.\nPassages for Further Study\nRom 12:4-8; 1 Cor 12:7-31; 14:26-33; Eph 1:23; 4:11-13; Col 1:24; 2:18-19; 1 Tim 3:1-16",

    "content": "Loving Others\nJesus spoke of loving one’s neighbor as the second most important of the Old Testament commandments (Mark 12:31). In fact, love summarizes the entire Old Testament law (22:40; cp. Matt 7:12; 9:9-13; 12:1-13; see Rom 13:8-10). Jesus criticized the Pharisees for their failure to show love (Matt 9:13; 12:7; 23:4, 13-14, 23). Love is the mark of a true follower of Jesus (John 13:34-35) and of an authentic experience of God (1 Jn 2:9-11; 3:11-18; 4:7-21).\nFor Paul, love is more important than any of the spiritual gifts and the most important virtue. Love “binds us all together in perfect harmony” (Col 3:14). Without love, ministry has limited value (1 Cor 13:1-3). Paul summed up the whole of Christian ethics as “faith expressing itself in love” (Gal 5:6). Love is the natural outworking of Christian faith, the primary fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5:22), and the most important motivation for ministry. As believers grow in Christ, they will seek more and more to love others as he did.\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 19:18; Hos 6:6; Matt 7:12; 9:9-13; 12:1-13; 22:37-40; 23:2-4, 13, 23; John 13:34-35; Rom 13:8-10; 1 Cor 13:1-13; Gal 5:6, 22-23; Col 3:12-14; 1 Jn 2:7-11; 3:11-18; 4:7-21",

    "content": "The Resurrection of the Dead\nJesus spoke of a future resurrection of all people—either to eternal life or to judgment (Mark 12:26-27; John 5:28-29; 6:39-40, 44, 54; 11:25-26; cp. Luke 20:34-36). When Christ returns, all his people will be resurrected to be with him forever (1 Thes 4:13-18; cp. 2 Cor 5:1-10).\nThis strong hope characterized the outlook of the early Christians. They were able to endure their suffering because their eyes were fixed on what lay beyond this life (2 Cor 4:16-18; cp. Heb 12:2). They expected Jesus to return and resurrect their bodies, and they looked forward to living with him forever (1 Pet 1:3-6, 23). Their faith was based on the foundation of Jesus’ own bodily resurrection (1 Cor 15:12-20; Acts 4:33; see also 2 Cor 4:14).\nResurrection bodies will be fundamentally different from the bodies we experience in this life, with all of their limitations and failings. These renewed bodies will be glorious, strong, immortal, and spiritual, like Christ’s own resurrection body (1 Cor 15:35-58).\nBecause they are already joined to Christ, believers actually begin to experience resurrection existence here and now. They have already been “raised” with Christ; they have already been given “resurrection life” (Rom 6:4-11; 8:10-11; Col 2:12). As a result, their lives are now centered in the spiritual realities of heaven rather than in worldly things (Col 3:1-4). Believers can experience the transforming power of that new life here and now, the new life of the Spirit that frees them from the power of sin and death (Rom 8:1-4). In all the difficulties they face, their trust is not in themselves but in the resurrection power of God (2 Cor 1:9).\nPassages for Further Study\nJob 19:25-27; Pss 16:10; 49:15; Dan 12:2-3; Matt 16:21; 28:1-10; Mark 12:18-27; John 3:13-16; 5:25-30; 6:39-40; 11:21-27; Acts 2:23-24; 3:14-15; 4:33; 10:39-41; 17:2-3; 24:15; 26:22-23; Rom 1:4; 4:25; 6:4-11; 8:10-11; 1 Cor 15:12-58; 2 Cor 1:8-9; 4:13-18; 5:1-10; Eph 1:19-20; Col 2:12; 3:1-4; 1 Thes 4:13-18; 1 Pet 1:3-6, 23; Rev 20:11-15; 21:1-7; 22:1-6",

This new covenant was initiated by Christ (see Luke 22:19-20), who removes the veil associated with the old covenant (2 Cor 3:14). Using the creation story of Genesis 1–2, Paul explains how the God of creation is also the God of the new creation (2 Cor 4:4-6; 5:17). God is now revealed in Christ, who brings God close to us.\nIn the new covenant, God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is also our Father because he has enabled us to be adopted as his children (2 Cor 1:3; Gal 3:26–4:7). He is the faithful God whose Old Testament promises are fulfilled in the Messiah (2 Cor 1:18-22). And he is the author of reconciliation (5:18-21), as Christ became the means by which God won the sinful world back to himself. Jesus Christ became one with sinful humankind (see 8:9) and released God’s saving power and righteousness to restore the broken relationship between God and the world.\nUnder the new covenant, God sends his Spirit to dwell among his people. The Spirit gives believers life, freedom, and the ability to conform to Christ (3:6, 17-18). The Spirit unites us to Christ and serves as the guarantee of our complete salvation in the resurrection (1:22; 5:1-5), when believers’ mortal bodies will be transformed into glorified bodies (1 Cor 15:42-57). Paul gives a full account of this hope in 2 Cor 5:1-10. This will be the final outcome of the new covenant that God has established for his people.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 9:1-17; 12:1-9; 15:1-21; Exod 19:3-6; 2 Sam 7:5-16; 1 Chr 10:13-14; Isa 59:20-21; 65:17-25; Jer 2:1–3:10; 31:31-34; Matt 26:27-29; Luke 22:20; 1 Cor 11:23-32; 2 Cor 3:4-18; 4:4-6; Heb 8:6-13; 9:11-28; 10:1-25; 12:18-24",

    "content": "The Message of Reconciliation\nReconciliation is a term found throughout the New Testament. In Romans 5:1-11, Paul concentrates on the cost of God’s reconciling work in the death of his son. Colossians 1:15-20 is a hymn in praise of the cosmic scope of reconciliation, focused on the exalted Lord who is ruler of all. In Ephesians 2:11-22, the emphasis is on the reconciliation that embraces both Jews and Gentiles to form a united church with all hostility broken down.\nPaul’s fullest exposition of reconciliation comes in a discussion of the meaning of Jesus’ death in 2 Corinthians 5:18-21. Earlier, Paul had reminded the Corinthians of the centrality of the cross (1 Cor 15:3-5) but had not elaborated much at that point on the meaning of that saving event. Now he explains what Christ’s death on the cross means: Christ identified himself with human sin so that sinners might be restored to their family relationship with God. This reconciliation turns enemies into friends. The cost of this exchange is that “God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ” (2 Cor 5:21).\nWith the resurrection of Jesus and his triumph over death, a new world is born—a new era in which God’s people have the promise of eternal fellowship with him (see 2 Cor 4:14–5:10). Those who have trusted in Christ for salvation have received the gift of the Holy Spirit, the guarantee of future salvation (5:5). They know that God has accepted them and will welcome them forever.\nThose who have been reconciled to God are called to participate in the ministry of reconciliation, helping people find their way back to God (2 Cor 5:18-21). And because believers have experienced this reconciliation, they are to pursue opportunities for reconciliation in their interpersonal relationships as well (see Matt 5:24; 18:15; Rom 12:18).\nPassages for Further Study\nEzek 45:15; Dan 9:24; Matt 5:24; 18:15; Acts 10:36; Rom 5:1-2; 8:6-9, 15-16; 12:18; 15:13; 2 Cor 5:18-21; 13:11; Eph 2:11-18; Col 1:19-22; Heb 2:17",

    "content": "The Church as God’s Temple\nThe imagery of the church as the temple of God has its roots in the Old Testament. David and Solomon received a promise that the Temple in Jerusalem would be the place of God’s abiding presence with his people (see 2 Sam 7:12-16; 1 Kgs 9:1-9). That Temple was completed in 960 BC but was destroyed in 586 BC. Yet the prophets of Israel looked forward to a new temple; they announced a message of hope that God would once again live among his people (see, e.g., Isa 56:7; Ezek 40–43).\nWhile the Temple in Jerusalem was rebuilt after the Exile—and reached a pinnacle during the renovations of Herod the Great—the hopes of God’s people were ultimately fulfilled in the coming of Jesus (see John 1:14; 2:19-22; 4:21-24). He himself is God’s temple, the place where God’s holiness resides, and he calls his people to join him. Thus, God’s people are to be a holy temple of God, a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit (see 1 Cor 3:16-17; 6:19; 2 Cor 6:16; Eph 2:21; 1 Pet 2:5; Rev 3:12).\nPaul called on believers to realize their identity as God’s “holy people” (2 Cor 1:1) in two ways: They were to separate themselves from moral evil, and they were to be dedicated to God in holy living and service. Christians are therefore urged, “Let us cleanse ourselves from everything that can defile our body or spirit. And let us work toward complete holiness because we fear God” (2 Cor 7:1).\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Sam 7:12-16; 1 Kgs 8:12-53; 2 Chr 6:20; Pss 11:4; 27:4-6; Zech 6:12-15; Matt 18:20; John 2:18-22; 14:20; 17:23; Rom 8:10; 1 Cor 3:10-17; 6:18-20; 9:11-14; 2 Cor 6:14–7:1; Gal 2:20; Eph 2:20-22; 3:17-19; Col 1:27; Heb 3:6; 12:18-24; 1 Pet 2:4-9; Rev 1:12-16; 3:12, 20; 21:22",

    "content": "Christian Giving\nBountiful giving is a mark of true grace. We see its sublime expression in the Lord of glory, who by his poverty became one with us and made us rich (2 Cor 8:9; Phil 2:5-8). We have received his unmerited favor in salvation, and we give sacrificially in response to “this gift too wonderful for words!” (9:15).\nJesus taught that generosity would be one evidence of those who follow him (Matt 25:34-36), and he stressed the importance of a person’s intentions and attitude, not simply the amount given (Mark 12:41-44).\nPaul dedicates a lot of his attention in 2 Corinthians to the theme of giving. The church at Corinth was encouraged to give generously in response to human need, specifically the needs of the poor Jewish Christians in Jerusalem (2 Cor 8:6-7; 9:1-5). It would be a sign that the Gentile Christians were one body with the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem.\nPaul’s teaching on Christian giving in can be summarized as follows:\n(1) Our giving should spring from a willing mind and heart (2 Cor 8:12; 9:7). Paul emphasizes motives because all giving should hinge on why we give.\n(2) True giving is a joy, in contrast with grudging gifts (9:5). There is joy in sowing seed, like a farmer who anticipates a crop (9:6-10); and there is joy in sharing with others in need (9:1-2).\n(3) Christian giving is marked by generosity and may entail sacrifice, as it did for the Macedonians (8:1-5).\n(4) The handling of financial gifts calls for honesty, integrity, and care. Paul was careful to deflect any suspicion of his colleagues who were sent to collect gifts from the churches (8:20-21). Those who handle monetary gifts in the church should be persons of proven reputation and responsibility.\nChristian living is to be marked by a generous concern for those in need, and Paul instructs believers to please God, not themselves (5:15). Believers are called to live under Christ’s lordship and be motivated by his love (5:14). We can demonstrate his love tangibly in our giving.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 25:2; 35:5; Lev 25:35; Deut 15:7-11; 16:17; 1 Chr 29:9; Prov 3:9-10; 11:24-26; 21:13; 28:27; Mal 3:8; Matt 5:42; 6:3-4; 10:8; 19:21; Luke 6:38; 11:41; 12:33-34; 18:22; Acts 11:29; 1 Cor 13:3; 16:2-3; 2 Cor 5:17-18; 2 Cor 8:1–9:15; Phil 2:3-11",

    "content": "Paul’s Apostolic Service\nTo understand Paul’s role as an apostle of Jesus Christ, there is perhaps no better place to look than Paul’s own description in 2 Corinthians. In this letter, Paul reveals the heart of his ministry. Paul was God’s special messenger for the establishment and nurture of churches in the Gentile world. His service was marked by seriousness and sincerity, and his message raised life and death issues (2 Cor 2:15-17). As a pioneer missionary, he took the Good News to places where Christ’s name was not yet known (see Rom 15:20-21).\nPaul’s message of Good News was clear and incisive (see, e.g., 2 Cor 5:1-21), and it was backed up and illustrated by his own life. He always sought to minister with truth and integrity (2:17; 4:2). And as Paul carried the message of Christ, the cross served as the pattern for his ministry to others (11:16-33).\nPaul’s authority was apparently disputed, so he needed to offer a personal account of how God had called him as an apostle and established his ministry at Corinth (10:12-18). For those who demanded proof of Paul’s credentials (13:3) and who criticized his weaknesses, he simply pointed to the cross of Jesus (13:4) and to the lessons he had learned from it (see 4:10). Paul was quite conscious of his own limitations and that he needed divine grace to accomplish his work. But true apostolic authority expresses itself precisely in human weakness reinforced by divine strength (12:1-10).\nPaul also performed miraculous works to verify his claim to apostleship (12:12). These works apparently were not enough to prevent doubts from arising in the young church at Corinth. Yet Paul exercised his ministry with great patience, not giving up when the Corinthians challenged him. This patience replicates that of Jesus, who endured much hositility from others (Heb 12:2-3).\nPaul’s example provides a few lessons for all those who are involved in Christian service: (1) Christian leaders should take criticism as a summons to self-examination, to see if any accusation is well-founded. (2) Christian leaders should be patient in the face of groundless opposition, staying focused on the task at hand. (3) There is a place for reasoned defense and explanation of one’s motives, while at the same time recognizing that the Lord is the ultimate Judge.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 10:5-42; 28:18-20; Mark 1:17; 2:14; 3:14-15; John 21:15-17; Acts 1:2-8, 20-26; 2:42-43; 4:33; 5:12; 6:2-4; 10:39-43; 14:3; Rom 1:5; 15:17-21; 1 Cor 4:8-13; 12:28-29; 2 Cor 2:17; 4:2; 6:3-12; 10:12-18; Eph 2:20; 3:4-5; 4:11-13; 1 Thes 2:7-12",

    "content": "Righteousness by Faith\nA key issue that emerged in the first-century church was whether or not Gentiles who received the Good News had to follow Jewish regulations—including circumcision—in order to be able to join the family of God.\nFor Paul, the answer was simple: There is nothing people can or need to do. Only Christ could do—and has done—what must be done to make people right with God. Our response is simply to receive his gift, gratefully thank him for what he has done for us, and trust in him.\nFor Jewish Christians in the first century, it was hard to accept this answer. From the time of Abraham, right relationship with God had been marked by circumcision, the rite of cutting off the male foreskin (Gen 17:9-14). Every male who was part of God’s family had to be circumcised, and those who neglected to do so were cut off from God’s people. Those who had received circumcision were also expected to keep the rest of the law, including the Sabbath and dietary regulations.\nWhen the Christian faith moved from the Jewish to the Gentile world, it was natural for questions to arise. Do Christians need to be circumcised—and keep God’s law in general—to be accepted as part of God’s family? Or does God accept people purely on the basis of their faith in Christ’s work on the cross? As Paul’s mission to Gentiles advanced, these questions became pressing.\nThe apostle Peter understood from his vision in Joppa and his experience in Caesarea that God has accepted Gentiles as Gentiles, on the basis of their faith in Christ’s finished work (Acts 10:9–11:18). They did not have to become Jewish by observing circumcision, for Christ provided them open access to God by faith. Peter and the Jerusalem church therefore welcomed Gentile believers into fellowship. But later, Peter temporarily withdrew from fellowship with Gentiles when some Jewish Christians criticized him (Gal 2:11-13). In response, Paul rebuked Peter for communicating that Gentiles must become Jews in order to be accepted by God (2:14-21).\nNo one is accepted by God and made righteous before him on the basis of keeping the law (2:16). Even Abraham himself was counted as righteous because of his faith (Gen 15:6; Gal 3:6)—not because he was circumcised, which came later (Gen 17:9-14). Both Jews and Gentiles are made righteous before God on the basis of faith alone.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 15:6; Hab 2:4; Acts 10:1–11:18; Rom 1:17; Gal 2:14-21; 3:11; Heb 10:38",

    "content": "The Law and the Spirit\nAn enduring question of the Christian faith is, Do Christians need to keep the Old Testament law in order to become mature followers of Christ? Does following God’s law provide sanctification?\nWhen the Christians in Galatia had received the Good News of salvation through faith in Christ, they had also received the Holy Spirit as the guarantee of their status as believers. Not only had God given his Spirit to them, but he had also worked miracles among them (Gal 3:5). They knew from experience that the Holy Spirit has the power to make them new people, and Paul had taught them to rely on the Spirit to guide them.\nShortly after Paul left Galatia, Jewish-Christian teachers arrived who taught the need to observe God’s law, both to be accepted by God and to be sanctified and become mature. They argued that Paul’s approach to sanctification by the Spirit would lead to lawlessness and sin.\nPaul responded that, just as God counts us as righteous by faith, so also he makes us righteous by faith, through the working of the Spirit (Gal 5:16-26). Those who rely on the Spirit and follow his leading will not sin—God’s Spirit will never lead people to sin.\nThe real problem is not a lack of understanding regarding right and wrong. Our God-given conscience tells us when we’re doing wrong, and God’s law makes the requirements of his righteousness even clearer (Rom 7:7-12). The real problem is that, by nature, our hearts are hard and sinful, and we lack the wisdom to know the right thing to do in a given situation. By nature, we are unable to apply God’s word in a way that is consistent with his intentions.\nThe law cannot ameliorate our condition. But when the Holy Spirit guides and controls us, he changes our hearts to do the things that please God (Gal 5:22-23; Rom 8:5-14). God’s Spirit guides his people to fulfill his law in its true sense and intent. But fulfillment of the law must not be the goal or focus—the law is just our guardian (Gal 3:24-25). Instead, we focus on trusting God, relying on the Spirit, and loving others. God’s Spirit gives us the will and the power to do these things in a way that pleases God.\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 11:16-17, 24-30; Jer 31:33-34; Ezek 36:26-27; Luke 24:49; Acts 5:32; Rom 7:1–8:17; 12:2; 2 Cor 3:7-18; Gal 3:2-5; 5:5, 16-26; Heb 12:14-29",

    "content": "The Church\nThe church is the community of those who recognize the lordship of Christ and submit to him (Eph 5:21-24). In the Greek world, the word translated “church” (Greek ekklēsia) designated an “assembly” of people such as a regularly summoned political body or simply an informal gathering (e.g., Acts 19:32, 39, 41). Similarly, in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) the term is used to refer to the assembly of Israel (e.g., Deut 31:30). In the New Testament, ekklēsia is used to refer to (a) the entire body of Christ in the world (e.g., Matt 16:18; Eph 1:22); (b) all the believers in a given locale (e.g., Acts 9:31; 1 Cor 1:2); or (c) an individual local congregation that gathers regularly for worship, instruction, fellowship, and prayer (e.g., Rom 16:5; see Acts 2:42).\nThe New Testament uses a number of images to describe the church:\nThe Israel of God—the “new people of God” (Gal 6:16) who belong to him (1 Pet 2:9-10) and who are his “holy priests” to do his work in the world (1 Pet 2:5, 9)\nGod’s family (Eph 2:19)—the “household of God” (1 Tim 3:15), made up of those who have been adopted as God’s children and designated as his heirs\nA holy temple for the Lord (Eph 2:21-22)—the place where God lives by his Spirit (Eph 2:22; 4:6; 1 Cor 3:16-17; 2 Cor 6:16; Col 1:27)\nBody of Christ—the full expression of Christ in the world, with Christ as its head (Eph 1:23; 4:15; 5:23-24; 1 Cor 12:12-27; Col 1:18, 24)\nChrist’s pure bride—the one he died for, cares for, and cherishes, who will live in union with him forever (Eph 5:25-29)\nThe church is part of God’s plan to bring everything in heaven and on earth under the authority of Christ (Eph 1:9-10). Through Jesus Christ, God has called people from both Judaism and the Gentile world to be one new people of God (Gal 6:16), empowered by his Spirit to be present in the world, to worship him, and to share the Good News of his unconditional love (Eph 2:11-22). The church is both grounded in Judaism and is the fulfillment of God’s intention in calling Israel to become “a light to the Gentiles” who “will bring my salvation to the ends of the earth” (Isa 49:6; cp. Rom 11:1-5). In this new Jewish-Gentile community, the traditional barriers that divided people from one another and categorized them into inferior and superior classes—barriers of race, social standing, and sex—are shattered (Gal 3:28).\nThose who are united with Christ are members of his body. Paul expresses the reality of the intimate connection between Christ and his people in terms of the organic unity and integration of the physical body (Rom 12:4-8; 1 Cor 12:12-27). To be “in Christ” is therefore to be “baptized into one body by one Spirit” (1 Cor 12:12-13). As a result, “All of you together are Christ’s body, and each of you is a part of it” (1 Cor 12:27).\nBelievers do not relate to God in isolation but as part of this new family. To be “in Christ” is at the same time to be in the church. To be a Christian is to be incorporated into a community of people that is growing toward expressing the reality of Christ in its life together.\nBecause the church is one body, unity is called for. So Paul repeatedly urged the Christian community to be united and not to let their differences divide them from one another.\nBecause the church comprises people of different ethnic groups, it is to be a community of harmony and peace as believers live together in love, bound together by the shared experience of the Spirit (Eph 4:2-6). God’s goal for the church is that it will achieve the fullest possible experience of unity, faith, spiritual understanding, and Christian maturity—to the full perfection of Christ (4:13, 15; cp. Rom 8:29), the likeness of God himself (Eph 4:24, 32; 5:1).\nLike every part of a human body, every member of the church has his or her function. God has provided people in the church with many diverse gifts to build up the body and bring it to its full purpose (4:11-16; Rom 12:6-8; 1 Cor 12:7-11, 28).\nGod’s intention is that the church should be a showcase of his forgiving grace (Eph 2:7; 3:10), a community in which God’s glory can be seen, being devoted to the praise of that glory (3:21; 5:18-20).\nPassages for Further Study\nRom 8:29; 12:6-8; 1 Cor 3:16-17; 6:16; 12:7-28; Gal 6:16; Eph 1:9-10, 23; 2:7; 2:14–3:13; 4:2-6, 11-16; 5:18-20, 23-29; Col 1:18, 24, 27; 1 Tim 3:15; 1 Pet 2:5, 9-10",

    "content": "The Old Life and the New Life\nWhen people become believers in Christ, they are joined to him and begin to share in his death and resurrection. Their old life, marred by sin, dies with Christ, and they begin a new life by his power within them (see Rom 6:3-14). This is the work of God, who transforms them by his Spirit. Their minds are renewed (see Rom 12:2), their desires and actions change, and their lives begin to reflect his Spirit (Gal 5:22-23). They gradually grow into the likeness of Christ.\nBelievers also have a responsibility to live out Christ’s death and resurrection (see Phil 3:10-14). They are to turn away from darkness and embrace a life full of light (Eph 4:17–5:20). Paul speaks of this transformation by using the imagery of clothing. Believers are called to take off the old, sinful life driven by the devil and put on a new, pure life directed by the Holy Spirit (Eph 4:21-24; Col 3:1-15; see also Gal 3:27). As they do so, they recognize their reliance on God’s grace and power.\nPassages for Further Study\nRom 6:3-14; 12:1-2; Gal 5:19-23; Eph 4:17–5:20; Phil 3:12-14",

    "content": "Overcoming the Devil\nThe New Testament writers were convinced of the reality of evil and the dangers of the spiritual world. So they took Satan (the evil one, the devil) seriously as a real threat. The devil inhibits the work of God’s people (see 1 Thes 2:18; Rev 2:10), and he “prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour” (1 Pet 5:8).\nThe entire unbelieving world is subject to the power of sin and the devil (see Eph 2:2; 1 Jn 5:19). As the “god of this world,” the devil can blind the minds of unbelievers (see 2 Cor 4:4; cp. Matt 13:19). While Satan opposes God and seeks to destroy his people (Rev 12:12, 17), Jesus came to destroy Satan’s work (1 Jn 3:8). God turns what the devil intends for evil into good. Following this principle, Paul instructs the church at Corinth to expel someone from Christian fellowship in order that, by being exposed to the devil’s destructive power, that person might repent and be saved (see 1 Cor 5:5).\nChristians are to stand firm and resist the devil (Jas 4:7), praying for God’s deliverance (Matt 6:13) and availing themselves of the armor that God provides for their defense (Eph 6:10-20). Those who yield to Satan’s influence suffer the consequences (see Acts 5:1-5). But believers who walk with Christ are secure because they know that the cross has broken the devil’s power (see Rom 8:38-39; 1 Cor 15:24; Col 1:13; 2:10, 15; 1 Pet 3:22) and that the Lord protects them (see 1 Jn 5:18). They also know that the Holy Spirit within them is greater than the devil (see 1 Jn 4:4). By the word of God, they can overcome the evil one (see 1 Jn 2:14; cp. Rev 12:11).\nAlthough believers need to be wary of the devil and protect themselves from his power, they need not live in fear. The power of the devil is no match for the power of God. And in the end, the devil will be ultimately and totally defeated (see Rev 20:7-10).\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 6:13; 13:19; Acts 5:3-5; Rom 8:38-39; 1 Cor 5:5; 15:24; 2 Cor 4:4; Eph 2:2; 4:27; 6:10-20; Col 1:13; 2:10, 15; 1 Thes 2:18; Jas 4:7; 1 Pet 3:22; 5:8; 1 Jn 2:14; 3:8; 4:4; 5:18-19; Rev 2:10; 12:7-9, 11-12, 17",

    "content": "Living for Christ\nFrom prison Paul writes, “To me, living means living for Christ” (1:21). Why are believers called to devote their lives to Christ?\n1. Believers acknowledge that they owe everything to Christ, including their salvation. Devoting their life to his service expresses their eternal indebtedness and gratitude (see Rom 12:1).\n2. Believers acknowledge Christ as their master and Lord and submit to Christ’s rule in their lives. They recognize that they belong to the Lord and no longer live simply for themselves (see Rom 14:7-9; 2 Cor 5:14-15).\n3. Believers now share in Christ’s death and resurrection—they have died to themselves and have risen with him (see Rom 6:3-14; cp. Gal 2:19-20). They have a new identity in Christ (Rom 8:14-17; Eph 1:11, 14; Phil 3:20).\n4. Believers recognize that everything of value is found in Christ. Things of the world that once seemed important have lost their attraction; nothing compares to the infinite value of knowing Christ (Phil 3:7-11; Eph 1:3–3:21; Col 1:15–3:4).\nPassages for Further Study\nRom 6:3-14; 8:14-17; 12:1; 14:7-9; 1 Cor 6:19; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Gal 2:19-20; Eph 1:11, 14; Phil 1:21; 3:7-11, 20",

    "content": "The Christ Hymn: Christ’s Divine Nature\nPhilippians 2:6-11, often called the Christ Hymn, reveals early Christian beliefs about the nature of Jesus Christ. This hymn affirms that the early Christians believed in the preexistence and divine nature of Christ (see also Col 1:15-20; 2:9; cp. John 1:1-2; Heb 1:1-3). Christ is not simply another human prophet. He was present with God the Father from the very beginning, and he is the one through whom the universe was created. As the Son of God, he shares the nature of God himself. This claim was a major point of contention between Jesus and the religous leaders, who accused Jesus of blasphemy (John 5:16-18; 8:54-59; 10:30-39).\nThe hymn also affirms that Jesus Christ came to earth in an act of immense humility—the infinite God became human (Phil 2:7; see Col 1:15; John 1:10-14; Heb 2:14, 17). Jesus Christ, the glorious Creator of the universe, died as a sacrificial offering for the sins of human beings so that we might be forgiven and be reconciled to God (Phil 2:8; see John 3:14-17; Rom 5:9-10; Col 1:20, 22; 2:13-14; Heb 1:3; 10:9-14), as the Scriptures had foretold (see Isa 53:3-12).\nThis hymn also affirms that God raised Jesus from the dead, has given him “the place of highest honor” in heaven (Phil 2:9), and conferred on him the title “Lord” (2:11; cp. Col 1:18). One day, all created beings will bow before him and acknowledge that he is Lord of the entire universe (Phil 2:9-11), deserving of the worship that God alone is worthy to receive (see Rev 5:8-14).\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 53:3-12; John 1:1-2, 10-14; 3:14-17; Rom 5:9-10; Phil 2:6-11; Col 1:15-22; 2:9, 13-14; Heb 1:1-3; 2:14, 17; 10:9-14; Rev 5:8-14",

    "content": "Christian Joy\nIn the last hours of his life, Jesus expressed a desire that his disciples “be filled with [his] joy” (see John 15:11; 16:20-24). The subject of joy emerges in a number of Paul’s letters and is a major theme in Philippians. Often when Paul encourages believers to be filled with joy, his words are directed toward those who are experiencing persecution—for example, believers in Philippi and Thessalonica (Phil 3:1; 4:4; 1 Thes 5:16).\nSuperficial happiness is dependent on circumstances. Christian joy is clearly different; it is rooted in a person’s relationship with the Lord, and it is resilient even in the midst of suffering and death. Joy comes in knowing that whatever happens, God will use everything for our ultimate good (see Rom 5:3-4; 8:28). Believers also have joy from the dynamic presence of God’s Spirit in their hearts (see Gal 5:22). The real secret to a joyful life is in continuously being “filled with the Holy Spirit” (see Eph 5:18). The attitudes of believers are not defined by outward circumstances, but by a relationship with the living God.\nPassages for Further Study\nJohn 15:11; 16:24; Rom 5:3-4; 8:28; Gal 5:22; Eph 5:18; Phil 3:1; 4:4; 1 Thes 5:16",

    "content": "The Secret of the Good News\nIn Paul’s letters, the word secret (sometimes translated mystery) is applied to the Good News. Sometimes secret is used as an abbreviation for the Good News itself (2:2; 4:3; 1 Cor 2:1; Eph 1:9; 6:19). Frequently, as in Col 1:26, Paul claims that the secret had been hidden in the past but has now been revealed (see also Rom 16:25; 1 Cor 2:7; Eph 3:9). Paul does not mean by this that the Good News is a secret that has to be probed or that it is some kind of Gnostic idea only a few can discover. Rather, he adapts the term from Jewish apocalyptic teaching (the term apocalyptic is from a Greek word that means “uncovering” or “revelation”; the same word supplies the name for the book of Revelation). In the apocalyptic perspective, the plan God has mapped out for all of history already exists in his mind but is hidden from human eyes until God chooses to disclose it. For Paul, the secret plan has now been disclosed in Christ, and it is broadcast throughout the world by his apostles.\nThrough the Old Testament prophets, God foretold many elements of the Good News, but he kept some aspects of it hidden until he revealed them in the New Testament era. These include the full participation of Gentiles as fellow-heirs with Jews (Col 1:27; Eph 3:1-9); the indwelling of Christ in believers (Col 1:27; 2:2); and the union of Christ and the church, as illustrated by the union of husband and wife (Eph 5:32). Some elements of God’s plan are still hidden and await further revelation, such as the salvation of all Israel (Rom 11:25-27) and the transfiguration of Christians at the time of Christ’s return (1 Cor 15:51-53).\nPassages for Further Study\nRom 11:25; 16:25; 1 Cor 2:1, 7; 15:51; Eph 1:9; 3:1-9; 5:32; 6:19; Col 1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3",

    "content": "Legalism\nThe law was of critical importance for the Jewish people, and their understanding of religion was largely centered on the observance of rules and rituals. This was natural to them because God had given his law to the Jewish people as a mark of his favor upon them and as a way for them to ratify the covenant agreement he had made with them. However, many Jews added to the laws that God had given his people, trying to develop rules for virtually every situation in which they might find themselves. Their motivation was often a positive desire not to transgress any of God’s laws. As Jesus often pointed out, however, the rules developed by religious leaders sometimes became obstacles to obeying God’s instructions (Mark 7:1-15). Furthermore, many Jews thought that following the law would automatically endear them to God.\nPaul frequently confronted this kind of problematic legalism in the early churches. For example, in Colosse, false teachers, influenced by Jewish beliefs, were insisting that Christians follow certain rules as a way of expressing their faith (Colossians 2:16-23). Paul criticized this in light of faith in Christ. As the culmination of all God’s plans and purposes, Christ is the center of all true piety.\nThis does not mean that rules for conduct are inherently bad. Some rules, such as the prohibition on lying (Col 3:9), clearly manifest an aspect of Christ’s character. Paul also had no problem with individual Christians imposing rules on themselves that they think are conducive to their own growth in Christ (cp. Rom 14:5; 1 Cor 8). But they must not require others to obey these self-imposed rules.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 23:13-33; Mark 7:1-15; Gal 2:14-21; Col 2:16-23",

    "content": "The Last Things and the Thessalonians\nThe Thessalonian believers heartily embraced Paul’s teaching about the day of the Lord and Christ’s second coming, but this instruction generated questions and speculations about the end times. What would happen to believers who died before Jesus’ return (1 Thes 4:13-18)? When would the day of the Lord come (5:1-11)? Would believers suffer the wrath of God (1:10; 5:9)? Paul calms the congregation by clarifying these topics (4:13–5:11) and reminding them of the teaching they had already received.\nAlthough Paul expected Jesus’ return to happen during his lifetime (4:15), he also recognized that the final event would come at an unpredictable moment, “like a thief in the night” (5:2). The way to be ready for the end is not by knowing the date but by living with Christian alertness, a constant spiritual watchfulness and readiness to meet Christ.\nThe Thessalonians also needed to understand the deaths of fellow believers. Paul says nothing about the condition of believers between their death and the return of Christ. Instead, he emphasizes the resurrection. Just as Christ was raised, those who die as believers will be raised when he returns. In fact, they will rise from the dead first and then be caught up together with the living believers to meet Christ in his royal coming.\nDespite Paul’s efforts to clarify the Christian hope, the Thessalonian believers became confused by false teaching that the day of the Lord had already begun (see 2 Thes 2:2). As a counterpoint to this false teaching, Paul further addressed this topic in his second letter to the young church (see 2 Thes 2:1-12).\nPassages for Further Study\nMark 13:1-37; 1 Thes 4:13–5:11; 2 Thes 2:1-12",

    "content": "“He Will Come”\nJesus promised his followers that he would return so that he could bring them to be with him forever (John 14:1-3). Immediately after Jesus ascended to heaven, the apostles received a message that he would someday come back (Acts 1:9-11). And in the visions that are recounted in the book of Revelation, John again hears from Jesus the promise of his return (22:6-20).\nThis final consummation of all things—the “day of the Lord” (2:2)—will come when least expected, like “a thief in the night” (1 Thes 5:2). Only the Father knows when that day will be (Matt 24:36; Acts 1:6-7). The present is not a time for speculation but for hope and confidence. Setting dates and times is not the way Christians should approach questions about the end. Scripture teaches about final things (eschatology) to give hope in the midst of trouble and perspective on present life and conduct. Hence, though Paul lays out certain events that will precede the day of the Lord, such as apostasy and the appearance of the man of lawlessness (2 Thes 2:1-12), the details are not the focus of his attention. Rather, he reminds his audience of these events (2 Thes 2:5) in order to refute false teaching and to encourage believers who are facing persecution (2 Thes 1:3-10).\nWhen Christ comes, he will destroy the enemies of the Good News, rescue persecuted believers (2 Thes 1:7-10), and gather his followers to be with him for eternity (1 Thes 4:13-17). This future event calls for a present response. Those who receive the Good News and live for God can have confidence of rescue. Those who reject God will experience everlasting destruction. God’s choosing and calling of believers is their hope and comfort (2:13-14). They can stand firm in the present as they face the future (2:14-15), knowing what will be the outcome when he comes.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 25:1-46; Acts 1:6-7; 1 Thes 4:13–5:11; 2 Thes 1:7-10; 2:1-12",

    "content": "Work and Patronage\nWhen Paul first visited Thessalonica, he taught the believers to work for a living rather than being unnecessarily dependent on others.\nYet some of the Thessalonians refused to work. Paul dealt with these idle Christians in his first letter to them (1 Thes 4:11-12; 5:14), but they remained entrenched and had not changed their ways. Why did they refuse to work? Possibly, these believers so vividly expected a quick return of the Lord that they gave up all work. Paul’s teaching about the coming of the Lord, however, never contradicted his basic instruction about the necessity of work (2 Thes 3:6, 10).\nThese idle Christians may have been clients of prominent patrons. Patronage was a fundamental feature of the Roman economic world. Rich patrons often supported numerous clients in various ways, such as by giving them food or money and by representing them in public assembly. Having numerous clients increased the honor of a patron. However, being a client brought social obligations that Paul would have wanted the Thessalonian believers to avoid, especially because their patrons were most likely non-Christians.\nPaul set for the Thessalonians an example of self-reliance. While he was among them, he supported himself (1 Thes 2:9; 2 Thes 3:7-9). Although Paul believed that “those who work deserve to be fed” (see Matt 10:10; 1 Cor 9:13-16), he did not receive support from the Thessalonians (he did accept offerings from the Philippians, Phil 4:15-16). Paul wanted the Thessalonians to know that he did not come to them as a smooth talker hoping for monetary gain (1 Thes 2:5, 9). He wanted them to understand from his example how they themselves should live.\nPassages for Further Study\nMatt 10:10; 1 Cor 9:13-16; Phil 4:15-16; 1 Thes 2:5, 9; 4:11-12; 5:14; 2 Thes 3:6-10",

    "content": "Women’s Roles in the New Testament Church\nPaul’s words in 1 Timothy regarding women’s roles in the church were intended to correct what was happening in Ephesus, but the extent to which this passage applies to other situations is a subject of discussion. The possible understandings include the following three:\nUniversal Interpretation. Galatians 3:28 (“There is no longer . . . male and female”) does not negate creational gender distinctions and roles. Even if Galatians 3:28 represents the ideal of equality in God’s eternal Kingdom, gender roles should still be ordered as outlined in 1 Timothy 2:11-15 for as long as this creation continues. By way of comparison, Matthew 22:30 discusses the status of marriage in the new creation—it differs from the structure of this creation outlined in Genesis 2:23-24, and it applies to the present life only in a special and limited sense (see 1 Tim 4:3-5; Matt 19:11-12; 1 Cor 7:29-35). The structure of the new creation will be fully realized in the coming age, and it is not the ideal for the present time. Therefore, Christian women in all times and places must recognize their role in the created order of God. They must not teach men or exercise authority over men in the church (see also 1 Cor 11:2-16; 14:34-35).\nPolemical Interpretation. Paul was addressing a particular situation created by the false teaching within the Ephesian church (see 1 Tim 1:18-20; 4:1-5; cp. 2 Tim 3:6-9). Evidence suggests that this teaching was disturbing family relationships (see 1 Tim 4:3; Titus 1:11). It is possible that Ephesian women, caught up in the local heresy, were abusing Genesis 1–3 in their teaching. They might have been asserting female domination in the final resurrection (which, according to some of the Ephesians, had already occurred; 2 Tim 2:18) and accentuated Adam’s blame for the Fall. Paul corrects their misreadings by alluding to the biblical text, but his point is not to make a universal statement about the status of women in the church. His concern is merely to silence the false teachers in Ephesus, including the women among them. First Timothy 2:11-15 entails a rebuke with loss of privilege specifically for those false teachers.\nCultural Interpretation. Paul’s argument was not necessarily directed to a local problem in Ephesus, but it presupposes a strongly patriarchal society, both in concern for public decorum (women in their place, showing proper honor to men) and in handling Genesis 2:7, 22. This shows that Christians must respect cultural norms insofar as possible in their evangelistic mission (1 Cor 9:19-23). In addition, most women in that society had limited training as teachers. Their society, in contrast to many twenty-first-century societies, usually educated women poorly. Because of that culture’s patriarchal structure, women would not normally have qualified as teachers and leaders. First Timothy 2:11-15, therefore, reflects the notion that properly qualified people should lead and teach. At the same time, there are examples in Paul’s writings and in the early church of women participating in various facets of ministry (e.g., Acts 18:26; Rom 16:1-7; 1 Cor 11:5). This leads to questions about the universal applicability of Paul’s statements on women in the church.\nChristians continue to discuss these complex issues. Many Christians today subscribe to a complementarian viewpoint, affirming distinct gender roles in the church, while many others take an egalitarian position, supporting the notion that men and women share equal roles in the church. All Christians affirm, however, the equality of men and women with respect to their identity as beloved children of God (see Galatians 3:26-28).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 2:23-24; Acts 18:26; Rom 16:1-7; 1 Cor 11:2-16; 14:34-35; Gal 3:28; 1 Tim 2:11-15",

    "content": "The Household\nThe household was the basic unit of Greco-Roman society; it was believed that the stability of the state rested upon the stability of the household. Roles and responsibilities were well defined and deeply ingrained. The central concern was to maintain the “natural” ordering of authority and subordination, the violation of which would lead to degradation and corruption. In this framework, the husband-father-master was over all. The public space of society and government belonged to men, the private space of the home belonged to women. It was not uncommon for Greco-Roman orators to accuse new foreign cults (as Christianity was perceived) of corrupting and destabilizing society, precisely by threatening the structure of the household.\nThe New Testament household codes (see Eph 5:21–6:9; Col 3:18–4:1; 1 Tim 2:8-15; 5:1-2; 6:1-2; Titus 2:1–3:8; 1 Pet 2:18–3:7) were therefore not innovations, even if these catalogs were adapted by the apostles to fit the Christian faith and to address particular needs. In practice, the Christian faith would result in the significant modification of cultural norms. Yet wisdom and loving restraint were needed, because heedlessly violating cultural norms created destructive upheaval and threatened to bring disrepute, disgrace, and shame on the entire household—including Christ, its head. This seems to be the effect of certain false teachers in Ephesus, as discussed in 1 Timothy. In this context, the New Testament household codes guided Christian communities toward a life that (1) silenced the accusations of unbelievers that Christianity was a threat to the state; and (2) served as a compelling, winsome witness to the truth.\nPassages for Further Study\nEph 5:21–6:9; Col 3:18–4:1; 1 Tim 2:8-15; 3:5, 12, 15; 5:1-2, 8; 6:1-2; Titus 2:1–3:8; 1 Pet 2:13–3:7; 4:17; 5:1-5",

    "content": "The Mantle of Leadership\nThe mantle of Christian leadership is the garb of servants who suffer for those they lead (Mark 10:35-45). For Paul, the essence of good leadership was to provide an example that mirrored Christ’s own example. The cross of Christ was central for Paul, and it had total claim on his life. When he said, “I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death” (Phil 3:10; see Col 1:24), he was speaking of more than emotional turmoil or even of dealing with sin. He meant suffering violently and bodily. Paul endured suffering for the sake of those to whom he proclaimed the Good News, always putting their salvation before his own physical well-being (2 Tim 2:10; 2 Cor 4:8-12). The Christian leader’s life is a proclamation of Christ crucified, of God’s power through human weakness (2 Cor 12:8-10), and of God’s wisdom despite human foolishness (1 Cor 1:18-31). As Paul summoned Timothy to take up the mantle of leadership (2 Tim 4:1-5), he was also summoning Timothy to suffer with him (1:8; 2:3; 4:5), scorning the shame of the cross (1:8).\nIf leadership does not orbit faithfully around Christ as its self-giving center, it ceases to be leadership in Christ and fails to understand the Good News, as it tends to revolve around self. But leadership that is modeled after Christ is other-directed and sacrificial (see Phil 2:3-8). Such a leader is willing to endure suffering, knowing that those who have died with Christ will live with him and that those who endure hardship will reign with him (2 Tim 2:11-12).\nPassages for Further Study\nJohn 13:15; Acts 20:35; 2 Cor 4:8-12; Eph 5:2; Col 1:24; 1 Thes 1:6-7; 2 Thes 3:9; 1 Tim 1:16; 4:12; 2 Tim 1:8, 12; 2:3, 10-12; 4:1-5; Titus 2:7; Heb 6:12; 13:7; 1 Pet 2:21; 5:1-4",

    "content": "Church Leaders\nSpontaneity and spiritual giftedness characterized the first church gatherings (see 1 Cor 14:26-33). The apostles exercised general oversight of the Christian communities (Acts 6:2; 8:14; 14:23) together with the elders in Jerusalem (Acts 15:4, 6, 22-23), whose function was drawn from the Jewish synagogue and Greco-Roman models. The titles and functions of Christian leaders in communities outside of Jerusalem appear to have been fluid (e.g. Acts 6:1-6; 13:1-3), but local leaders were dependent on the apostles when possible. Teachers and prophets also had important roles in guiding the church (see Acts 11:27-30; 1 Cor 14:26-40). Churches were often founded before their leaders were appointed (Titus 1:5; Acts 14:23). Such appointments were related to spiritual gifting (see 1 Cor 12:28-30; Eph 4:11-13) and (in some situations) to age.\nThere were likely always community leaders, whether or not they occupied a formal office. In the letters to Timothy and Titus, however, there is a strong emphasis on the offices of elder, overseer, and deacon. How these offices developed over the years is unclear, and even the practices described in 1 Timothy and Titus might not have been universal. Elders in Ephesus and on Crete may have carried more of a teaching role because the false teachers had to be decisively counteracted. Otherwise, the problems implied in 1 Corinthians 14:26-33 might have prevailed. These letters are more concerned with ensuring that the Good News be faithfully transmitted than with perpetuating a specific form of church government.\nThe apostle Paul exercised influence and control over his entire mission field, but there is no evidence that he intended to build or leave a regional or mission-wide infrastructure of governance. Apparently, the overseers were to carry on the teaching and disciplinary roles of Paul and his delegates without the wider responsibilities and authority of the apostles. As leaders of the local church, they wielded real and distinctive authority within their communities (see 1 Cor 5:3-5; 1 Tim 4:11-16; 5:19-22; 2 Tim 2:14-19, 25-26; Titus 2:15; 3:10-11). Yet it was not long after the death of the apostles that church structure began to take a more centralized form—largely around the office of bishop—as evidenced in Christian writings from the early second century.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 6:1-6; 13:1-3; 14:23; 15:4-35; 1 Cor 12:28-30; 14:26-33; Eph 4:11-13; 1 Tim 3:1-13; 4:11-16; 5:17-22; 2 Tim 2:2, 25-26; Titus 1:5-9; 2:15",

    "content": "Slavery in the New Testament Period\nSlavery was an accepted way of life in the Roman world. Prisoners of war were often made slaves, many were born into slavery, and individuals could voluntarily become slaves for a period of time to work off a debt. A large percentage of the population, including many Christians, were either slaves or freed slaves (see Acts 6:9). Why, then, did Paul not denounce slavery?\nThere appear to be two reasons. First, slavery in the Roman world was very different from the kind of slavery familiar to the Western world. Slavery was not race-based, and it was seldom lifelong; most slaves could expect to be freed by the age of thirty. In fact, a number of people sold themselves into slavery for upward social mobility into otherwise unattainable social circles. Some slaves were well educated and held responsible positions in their households and in society; many had amicable relations with their masters. In the Roman world, Christians like Philemon would have felt no compunction about owning slaves.\nThe second reason that Paul did not decry the institution of slavery was that his calling was not to change the structures of society, but to build the church—to see people converted and their lives spiritually transformed. For Paul, whether a believer is a slave or not is somewhat irrelevant, as are external circumstances generally; the important thing is serving Christ, whatever one’s situation in life. In other words, Paul is more concerned with Christian life and witness than with physical emancipation. So even slaves can do their work as an act of worship (Eph 6:5-8; Col 3:22-24; cp. 1 Tim 6:1-2). When Paul addresses Christian slaves, he encourages them to accept their lot as a calling in which they can serve Christ; he is their real Master, and in him they are really free (1 Cor 7:20-24).\nParadoxically, every Christian (whether slave or free), having been freed from the most tragic form of slavery—slavery to sin—can now experience true freedom by living as a slave of God and of righteousness (Rom 6:6-22). For Paul, this is the only kind of slavery and freedom that is ultimately significant.\nPassages for Further Study\nRom 6:6-22; 1 Cor 7:20-24; 9:19; Eph 6:5-8; Col 3:22-24; 1 Tim 6:1-2; Phlm 1:8-21",

    "content": "The Superiority of the Son\nThe author of Hebrews argues for the superiority of the Son as to both his person and his ministry. The superiority of the Son’s person is presented primarily in 1:1–3:6. In the book’s introduction (1:1-4), the Son is presented as the creator, sustainer, and heir of the universe (1:2-3), one who “radiates God’s own glory and expresses the very character of God” (1:3). He is the exalted one, who has achieved the cleansing of sins and has a status “far greater than the angels” (1:3-4).\nIn 1:5-14 and 2:5-18, the Son is shown to be superior to the angels. He has a unique relationship with the Father (1:5) and is the ruler, creator, and terminator of the created order (1:8-12). The angels have a status that is inferior to him, and they worship him (1:6-7). God the Father exalts him to the highest possible position of honor at his right hand (1:13; Ps 110:1), and he has authority over all things (Heb 2:5-8).\nIn 3:1-6, the author builds on the hearers’ great respect for Moses to make the case for the even greater respect due the Son. Like Moses, the Son was faithful in his ministry to the people of God. Yet the Son deserves more glory and praise than Moses, for he is identified with God the Father and is the ultimate builder of God’s house (3:3-4). The Son is ultimately in charge of God’s people (3:5-6).\nThe passages that focus on the superiority of the Son’s ministry are found primarily in 7:1–10:18. Through his superior high priesthood, Jesus has brought in a “better hope” (7:19), grounded in a “better covenant” (7:22), based on “better promises” (8:6), through which he performs a ministry “superior” to that of the priests of the old covenant (8:6). Christ’s ministry under the new covenant is a “better system” because of the superiority of his sacrifice (9:10, 23; see also 12:24). His ministry causes new-covenant believers to anticipate “better things” in terms of their inheritance (10:34), a “better . . . heavenly homeland” (11:16), and a “better life after the resurrection” (11:35). For new-covenant believers in Christ, God has something “better” that could only be anticipated by their old-covenant counterparts (11:40).\nPassages for Further Study\nPs 110:1; Heb 1:1-14; 3:1-6; 7:1–10:18; 10:34; 11:16, 35, 40",

    "content": "Apostasy\nSadly, opposition to God is not limited to those outside the community of faith; the Bible tells of many people who seemed to know God but turned away (see Num 16; Deut 13; 2 Kgs 17:5-23; Ezek 8). God brings just consequences to those who turn away from him (Job 11:20; Prov 1:24-31; Jer 11:11). Jesus spoke of those who fall away and the judgment they will receive (Matt 16:27; 23:13; 24:10-13; 25:41-46), and the writers of the New Testament follow his lead (Gal 1:6-9; 2 Tim 3:1-9; 2 Pet 2:1-22; 1 Jn 2:18-19).\nThe Bible as a whole is clear that disobeying God has severe consequences (see, e.g., Gen 9:5-6; Num 35:16-21; Lev 20:10; Zech 5:4). Those who oppose God’s will and rule will ultimately be excluded from his life-giving presence (Isa 66:14-24). In this vein, several passages in Hebrews warn that those who fail to take God’s word seriously are in deep spiritual trouble and will face the judgment of God (see Heb 2:1-4; 4:12-13; 6:4-8; 10:26-31; 12:25-29).\nScholars have understood the nature of the apostasy (falling away) and judgment described in the “warning passages” of Hebrews in various ways: (1) Some have understood the warnings to be hypothetical, suggesting that the harshness serves simply to shock the hearers out of spiritual lethargy, with no impending judgment in view. (2) A second position holds that those with whom the author was concerned were Jewish and had not yet converted to Christianity. Thus they were under God’s judgment because they were not yet a part of the new covenant. (3) A third view argues that the “apostates” in view were Christians who, because of their spiritual condition, faced some measure of God’s judgment as believers, but were in no danger of actually losing their salvation. (4) A fourth view suggests that the apostates had been full members of the Christian community and had experienced the full reality of the Christian faith but had now turned their backs on Christ and the church. (5) A fifth view is that, rather than having been true believers, the apostates showed that they never really knew Christ in the first place.\nUltimately, warnings of judgment are an expression of God’s grace, seeking to turn the rebellious person to the ways of God. Taking the consequences of apostasy seriously can help us build resolve in faithfully following Jesus.\nPassages for Further Study\nNum 16:1-50; Deut 13:1-18; 2 Kgs 17:5-23; Ezek 8:1-18; Matt 24:10-13; Gal 1:6-9; 2 Tim 3:1-9; Heb 2:1-4; 6:4-8; 10:26-31; 2 Pet 2:1-22; 1 Jn 2:18-19",

    "content": "God’s Sabbath Rest\nThe concept of God’s Sabbath rest, as found in Hebrews 4:1-11, has been a theological puzzle for commentators. The notion carries various connotations from the Old Testament, including the Promised Land as a place to rest from slavery and wandering and the Sabbath day as a weekly day of rest. In Hebrews 3:7-19, the author expounds on Psalm 95:7-11 and offers the wilderness wanderers as an example of those who failed to enter God’s rest because of their disobedience.\nBut what is this “rest” they failed to enter, which still remains for the people of God (Heb 4:1-3)? The author of Hebrews clearly had more in mind than the physical land of Canaan as the place of “special rest” (4:8-9). Genesis 2:2 speaks of God’s rest as something that he prepared from the foundation of the world (Heb 4:3-4). God’s rest relates to ceasing from one’s own work as God did from his (4:10). This rest can be entered by those who “hear his voice,” don’t harden their hearts, and believe the Good News (4:1-3, 7).\nIn the Old Testament, the Day of Atonement is called a “Sabbath day of complete rest” (Lev 16:29-31). On that day, people ceased completely from their own work. In the new covenant, Jesus as our Great High Priest has offered a once-for-all sacrifice that decisively dealt with sin (9:7-28). He has provided the ultimate atoning sacrifice, and he thus offers people a spiritual rest, which they enter by believing this Good News.\nGod’s rest that is available through Jesus has two aspects. First, those who believe in him have ceased from their own works—that is, they no longer work for God’s acceptance, but they trust in Christ’s finished work (Eph 2:8-9) and enjoy the blessings of peace with God (John 14:27; Acts 10:36; Rom 5:1; 2 Cor 5:19-21). Second, they look forward to an eternal life of rest and enjoyment in God’s presence (Isa 26:19; Rev 14:13). Jesus Christ gives complete and perfect rest (Matt 11:28-30).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 2:1-3; Exod 16:21-29; 20:8-11; 31:13-16; Lev 16:29-31; Isa 52:7; 54:13-14; 56:2, 4; 57:2, 21; 58:13; Ezek 20:20; Matt 11:28-30; Mark 2:23-28; Luke 8:48; John 14:27; Acts 10:36; Rom 5:1; 15:13; 2 Cor 5:19-21; Eph 2:17; Col 1:20; 2:16; 3:15; Heb 4:1-11; 2 Pet 1:2",

    "content": "God’s Word\nA foundational truth of Scripture is that God has spoken. The author of Hebrews, in line with other Jewish preachers of the era, presents the Old Testament as coming from the mouth of God, introducing those texts with “God says . . .” or something similar. God may speak a word of promise (Heb 6:13-14) or a word of punishment (3:11; 4:11-12); he may tell us something about himself or his Son (see 1:5-12) or reveal some aspect of his will (see 8:7-13; 10:5-7). God’s word created the universe and still governs it (Gen 1:3-28; Heb 1:3; 11:3).\nIn the past, God’s word came primarily through angels or prophets, but now it has come preeminently in the person of Jesus, God’s Son (Heb 1:1-4; 2:3-4; cp. John 1:1-14). The word is to be heard, heeded, obeyed, and believed as a source of hope.\nThrough his word, God initiates relationship with us and wants us to listen to him and respond in faith (see Gen 15:6; John 1:12). His word is authoritative and intentional, and it gives profound hope because God can be trusted to keep his promises (Heb 6:13-20).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 1:3-28; Deut 8:3; Pss 12:6; 19:8; 119:11, 89, 105; Isa 40:8; Jer 15:16; 23:29; 36:2; Matt 5:18; 7:24; John 1:1-14; 5:24; 2 Tim 3:16; Heb 1:1-4; 4:12; 6:13-20; 11:3; 1 Pet 1:25; 2 Pet 1:19-21",

    "content": "Spiritual Maturity\nWhen a person turns to Christ for salvation, it marks the beginning of a journey that will continue the rest of their life. Such a person does not simply remain as they are; they are transformed, growing continually into Christlikeness—a process often referred to as sanctification. Just as newborn babies drink milk in order to grow—eventually being able to eat solid food—new believers must avail themselves of “spiritual milk” in order to “grow into a full experience of salvation” (1 Pet 2:2-3), eventually consuming the “solid food” of deeper teaching (Heb 5:11-14).\nSpiritual maturity has to do with one’s ability to discern spiritual truth (1 Cor 2:6). Christians are exhorted to be mature in their thinking (1 Cor 14:20). The body of Christ grows to maturity through the equipping of believers and by growing in knowledge of the Son of God (Eph 4:11-16). The result is a united community of faith in which love and truth further build up the body of Christ.\nThe audience of Hebrews was spiritually immature. The author wanted to give them real spiritual meat, but they were acting like spiritual babies who needed basic nourishment rather than deeper teaching (5:12). They had not been listening to the word of God. They had been believers long enough to be teaching others, but a growing insensitivity had rendered them spiritually dull (5:11-12; cp. 1 Cor 3:1-3). They lacked the maturity to discern the basic difference between right and wrong (Heb 5:14). Thus, the author challenged them to move on to maturity so he could present them with deeper truths of the faith, rather than repeatedly recounting the basics (6:1-3).\nSpiritual maturity is not an automatic result of time. It results from focused listening to the word of God and living out that word in fellowship with a community of believers.\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Cor 2:6; 3:1-3; 14:20; 2 Cor 13:9-11; Eph 4:11-16; Col 4:12; Heb 5:11-14; 6:1-3; 10:14; 12:1-2; 1 Pet 2:1-3",

    "content": "Endurance\nAs Jesus was approaching his suffering and death, he informed his followers that they, too, would experience immense hardship (see Matt 24:9). In that context, he underlines the role of endurance: “The one who endures to the end will be saved” (Matt 24:13). Sure enough, many of the writings of the New Testament were directed toward believers who were experiencing suffering for their faith in Christ (see, e.g., 2 Thes 1:4; 1 Pet 4:12-19). These believers needed encouragement in order to persevere in the face of hardship while maintaining their commitment to Christ and their witness to others (see 2 Tim 4:5; 1 Pet 4:1). Through endurance, believers experience growth in their character and develop spiritual maturity (Rom 5:3-4; Jas 1:2-4).\nThe book of Hebrews was written to a group of believers who had experienced a number of difficulties in the past including harassment, loss of property, and imprisonment (Heb 10:32-34). At the time of writing, they were experiencing similar circumstances. Thus they needed to “hold firmly” to what they believed “without wavering” (4:14; 10:23) and to endure while anticipating the fulfillment of God’s promises (6:12; 10:36). Like runners in a race, they needed to stay on the path of obedience (12:1). And like true children of a loving father, they were to receive the Lord’s discipline in order to grow in holiness (12:5-13).\nAll believers can look to the great examples of endurance in Scripture, including Job and the prophets (Heb 11:35-40; Jas 5:10-11). Christ, our ultimate model of endurance, “endured the cross,” knowing the “joy awaiting him” (12:1-3). Our endurance is fueled by that same hope for the future.\nPassages for Further Study\nRom 5:3-4; 1 Cor 4:12; 2 Thes 1:4; Heb 6:12; 12:1-10; Jas 1:2-4; 5:11; 1 Pet 2:20",

    "content": "By Faith\nFaith is a foundational theme in Scripture, yet misconceptions about faith abound. Some see faith as meaning any form of spirituality (“he/she is a person of faith”). Others understand it as a resolute belief that something good is going to happen to them—it is a ticket to health and wealth. Still others think that faith is a blind leap against known facts. None of these ideas constitutes biblical faith.\nHebrews 11, one of the most loved passages of Scripture, provides an extensive essay on faith. It describes faith as involving confident action in response to what God has made known. As seen in the examples listed throughout the chapter, faith comes into play in a variety of life’s circumstances. The results of faith also vary. Some people get rescued, achieve success in life, and get some of what God has promised in their lifetimes. Others get mocked, beaten, tortured, put in prison, and killed. Faith is sometimes rewarded sooner and sometimes later, but regardless, people of faith anticipate the rewards because of their confidence in God’s character.\nWhat does it mean to live by faith? It means that in our various circumstances we live out our belief “that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him” (11:6). Those who live by faith take confident action based on what God has revealed about his character, seeking to do his will in all things.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 15:6; 2 Chr 20:20; Hab 2:4; Matt 9:29; 21:21; Luke 8:50; John 3:16, 36; 5:24; 11:25; 12:46; 20:30-31; Rom 5:1; 10:9, 17; Gal 3:6; 5:6; 1 Tim 1:19; 6:12; Heb 10:22, 38; 11:1-40; Jas 1:5-6; 2:14-26; 1 Jn 3:23; 5:4",

    "content": "Love in the Community of Christ\nLife in community is not always easy. The community of Christ—the church—has been prone to disunity and division throughout its history. Even in its earliest days, the church stuggled with issues of unity (see 1 Cor 1:11-17; Gal 2:11-16).\nThe answer to relational discord in the community of Christ is to exercise love toward our brothers and sisters in Christ. This command is grounded in the teaching of Jesus (Matt 22:37-40; John 13:34-35; see Lev 19:18), is expressed by Paul (Rom 13:8-10; 1 Cor 13:1-13), and is found elsewhere in the New Testament (1 Pet 1:22; 1 Jn 2:7-11; 3:10; 4:7). Loving others in the body of Christ is central to a Christian ethic (Rom 12:9-10; 1 Thes 4:9; 2 Pet 1:5-8).\nThis kind of love refers not to an emotion but to a commitment to meet others’ needs which is acted upon in concrete expression. In other words, followers of Christ are to relate to one another in such a way that our communities of faith are characterized by acts of love. The author of Hebrews provides an example of how love can be expressed in tangible ways within Christian communities: by showing hospitality, caring for the needs of those who are persecuted or imprisoned, being faithful in one’s marriage, and rejecting a life motivated by money (Heb 13:1-6).\nGreat confusion exists in the world about the nature of love and the character of the church. Therefore, there is a great need for the church to live out the Lord’s command to “keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters” (Heb 13:1).\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 19:18; Matt 22:39; John 13:34; Rom 12:10; 13:8; 1 Cor 13:1-13; 1 Thes 4:9; Heb 6:10; 10:24; 13:1-6; 1 Pet 1:22; 2 Pet 1:7; 1 Jn 2:10; 3:10; 4:7",

    "content": "The Coming of the Lord as Judge\nThe Bible is clear that there will be a day of judgment (Jas 5:3), and the book of James provides followers of Christ with both a warning and a promise regarding that day. James announces the future coming of the Lord as Judge (Jas 5:7-9; cp. Isa 26:21; Mic 1:3). God, who gave the law, is the Judge who has the power to save and destroy (4:12). Those who slander Jesus Christ and oppress his followers will be slaughtered (see 2:6-7; 5:5-6). If those who follow Christ neglect to show mercy (2:13), befriend the world (4:4), sin through speech (4:11; 5:9), or live to satisfy evil desires (4:1, 16), they, too, will be judged by the law that was intended to set them free (2:12).\nThe Lord’s future coming influences present realities. God already honors the faithful poor and humiliates the exploitative rich (1:9-10; 5:2-3). Christ’s followers have already become God’s prized possession as God is restoring all things (1:18). James declares that we should obey the royal law of the messianic kingdom (2:8), of which followers of Christ have become heirs (2:5).\nThe coming of the Lord may not be immediate, so James exhorts Christians to endure (1:3-4) and wait patiently for Christ’s return (5:7-8). They will receive the crown of eternal life (1:12) and reap the harvest of righteousness sown by a life of faithfulness to God (3:18).\nIn view of impending judgment, James exhorts Christ’s followers to resist the devil and to humble themselves before God (4:7). We must grieve over sin, live with pure intentions and behavior (4:8-9), and rescue any Christian brother or sister who is headed toward death (5:19-20). Like Elijah, we must practice faith, prayer, and confession (5:13-18). Like Job, we must endure suffering, discovering in the end the scope of God’s kindness and mercy (4:10; 5:11).\nPassages for Further Study\n1 Sam 2:10; Pss 2:7-12; 96:11-13; Isa 26:21; Mic 1:3; Matt 16:27; Luke 12:35-48; 18:8; John 5:22-30; Acts 10:42; 1 Cor 4:5; Jas 5:7-9; 1 Jn 2:28",

    "content": "The Holiness of God’s People\nGod called on the people of Israel to be holy because he had ransomed them from their slavery in Egypt (see Lev 11:45). He has also ransomed us through Jesus Christ, who paid the price to release us from slavery to sin and death (1 Pet 1:18). God has paid the ultimate price to set us free: He has given “the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God” (1:19). He has purchased our freedom from the empty way of life that people experience before coming to Christ.\nAt the heart of the lifestyle that God demanded of his people under the old covenant was the requirement that they be holy as God is holy (see Lev 19:2). God had rescued them from the domination of a cruel, foreign nation who served other gods; now they were to live as God’s people in the new land to which he was bringing them.\nPeter applies the same requirement to God’s people of the new covenant, those who have come to God through faith in Jesus Christ: “You must be holy in everything you do, just as God who chose you is holy” (1 Pet 1:15). This holiness has both a negative and a positive side. Negatively, to be holy is to separate from this world, to avoid the ways of thinking and acting that characterize people who do not know God. We turn away from our old sinful, pre-Christian lifestyle. As a result, God’s people truly are “temporary residents” (1 Pet 1:17)—their values do not stem simply from this present world. Positively, to be holy is also to be separate for God; it means that we imitate our Father and live out the values of our new homeland, the Kingdom of God.\nBelievers in Christ have been set free from the old, meaningless life and its values. We are to live as obedient children of our heavenly Father (1 Pet 1:14). Our Father has not only redeemed us in his love; he also, like a human father, disciplines his children. He will judge us “according to what [we] do” (1:17). For this reason, we must live before God in “reverent fear” (1:17), recognizing his holiness and majesty, and seeking by faith to express his holy character in our lives. The life of holiness is not merely an option for believers: We are justified by our faith, but authentic faith must always reveal itself in works of holiness that please our Father (see Jas 2:14-26).\nPassages for Further Study\nLev 10:3; 11:44-45; 19:2; Isa 29:17-24; 1 Cor 6:9-20; Heb 12:1-13; 1 Pet 1:15-18; Rev 21:5-8; 22:14-15",

    "content": "The New Community\nThe New Testament draws attention to the importance of the Christian community, an emphasis that sometimes gets lost in individualistic cultures. Though believers in Christ are individually converted and born again to a new life (John 3:3; 1 Pet 1:23), we are not intended to remain in isolation. God’s purpose is to build us together as “living stones” in his “spiritual temple” (1 Pet 2:5). God no longer inhabits a building on Mount Zion in Jerusalem; he now lives in and among his people by the Holy Spirit.\nThe promise that God would rebuild his temple (see Ezek 40–48) has been fulfilled as God dwells among his people (see John 1:14), who themselves constitute the “temple” under the new covenant. Only as we join together in worship, praise, and service will we function in the way God intended. Christians enjoy together the wonderful blessing of being the people God has chosen to carry out his mission to the world.\nAs 1 Peter 2:9 makes clear, the church is now what Israel was originally, a “chosen people” (see Deut 7:6), “royal priests,” “a holy nation” (see Exod 19:6), and God’s “very own possession” (see Exod 19:5). With that privileged status comes the responsibility to proclaim God to the nations. As we join in harmonious worship and together serve in various ministries, we “show others the goodness of God” (1 Pet 2:9).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 12:3; Exod 19:4-6; Deut 7:6; 2 Chr 5:13-14; Isa 11:1-16; John 1:14; 1 Cor 3:9-17; 6:19; 2 Cor 6:16-18; Eph 2:19-22; 1 Pet 2:4-10; Rev 3:12; 21:1-3, 22",

Christians who live a countercultural lifestyle in obedience to God should expect the culture to respond with hostility.

By suffering in fellowship with Christ, we can be confident of enjoying the glory that he has already won.\nFirst Peter focuses heavily on Christian suffering, especially unjust persecution at the hands of people hostile to the faith. The several themes about suffering that are woven throughout the letter find their climactic expression in 4:12-19.\nWe need to commit ourselves to doing what is right when we face suffering (4:19). Our difficulties can always provide an excuse for sinning, but when difficulties come our way, we must live exemplary lives, characterized by love for others. Our loving response to enemies in the midst of trials can be a powerful opportunity to share our faith. By treating our persecutors with love and kindness, we can make our faith respectable and even attractive to them.\nWe need to remember in our trials that God is both sovereign and faithful (4:19). He controls all the circumstances of life, and we don’t need to fear that a trial will come our way apart from God’s oversight or will.\nPassages for Further Study\nIsa 48:10; 52:13–53:12; 63:7-9; Mark 10:35-40; Acts 5:41; 9:16; 14:22; Rom 8:17-23; 2 Cor 1:5-7; 4:10; 12:10; Phil 1:29; Col 1:24; 1 Thes 2:14; 2 Thes 1:5; 2 Tim 3:12; Heb 2:9-10; 5:8; 13:12; Jas 5:11-13; 1 Pet 4:12-19",

    "content": "Early Christian Heresies\nThe Greek word hairesis, originally meaning “choice,” designates a sect or faction. For example, the Sadducees were a sect within Judaism (Acts 5:17), as were the Pharisees (Acts 15:5). The early believers in Jesus as the Messiah were known as “the sect of the Nazarenes” (Acts 24:5). In each of these verses, the word hairesis denotes nothing more than a sect.\nAfter the church grew and developed, any factious group within a local church was called a hairesis—that is, a sect that held opinions contrary to the truths established by the apostles. This is what Paul meant when he warned the Corinthian church that factious sects would develop among them (1 Cor 11:19).\nEventually, the word heresy came to connote teaching that deviates from the norm and causes individuals to break away from orthodoxy. Thus, Peter warned Christians about false teachers who would try to deceive believers with their heretical teachings (2 Pet 2:1). In the modern era, this is how the word heresy is usually understood; it is unorthodox teaching that damages the faith of some believers and causes divisive factions within the church.\nTwo heresies were particularly prevalent in the church around the time of John’s writings: Gnosticism and Docetism.\nGnosticism is characterized by claims to obscure and mystical knowledge. Many Gnostics believed in a hierarchy of beings in which there was an eternal god, from whom came a series of emanations of lesser spiritual beings, including the creator god, who was considered evil. This creator god fashioned the material world, including human beings. Thus, bearing similarities with Platonic thought, this strand of Gnostics believed that everything material was evil and that there was a more “real” spiritual realm. The goal for these Gnostics was to discover the spiritual seed within them—through secret knowledge (gnōsis)—which would enable them to leave the physical realm and join the spiritual realm. This generated varied responses to the physical realm, with some Gnostics practicing strict, ascetic avoidance of physical pleasure, while others indulged heavily in the “flesh,” regarding their actions in relation to this world as inconsequential.\nGnosticism developed through the interweaving of Christianity with Greek philosophy and emphasizes the need for additional, special knowledge that redefines the terms and practices of orthodox Christianity into something quite different. The Gnostics often incorporated Christ into their belief system, considering the Christ to be one of the various emanations from the supreme being. According to many Gnostics, this Christ taught some of his followers how to discover the spiritual spark within them and join the spiritual realm.\nA significant amount of Christian writings from the first couple of centuries of the church’s existence were penned as a response to Gnostic heresy.\nDocetism, a form of Gnosticism, held that Christ only seemed to have a human body with physical birth, death, and resurrection (dokeō is a Greek verb meaning “to seem”). An early Docetist was Cerinthus, who argued that the spiritual “Christ” came upon the human Jesus at his baptism and was present with him during his ministry, but departed prior to his suffering and death. This movement was concerned with protecting the divinity of God from being polluted by the human nature of Jesus. According to early church tradition, John vehemently opposed Cerinthus’s teachings (see Irenaeus, Against Heresies 3.3.4; cp. 1 Jn 5:5-8; 2 Jn 1:7).\nTrue Christians believe in the Incarnation—God becoming a real human being with flesh and blood. Jesus’ humanity was not a facade. He was truly human, sharing our flesh and blood, so that he could provide salvation for humanity through his own flesh and blood. Ignatius, a student of the apostle John and later the bishop of Antioch, wrote a series of letters refuting Docetism. Ignatius was the first one outside the New Testament writers to speak of the virgin birth of Jesus. He also emphasized the fact that the apostles touched the body of their risen Lord, and he said it was possible for him to face martyrdom with courage because of the real suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross and his physical resurrection.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 8:9-24; 2 Cor 11:1-15; Col 1:23; 2:6-23; 1 Tim 6:20; 2 Pet 2:1-22; 1 Jn 4:2-3; 5:5-8; 2 Jn 1:7-11; 3 Jn 1:9-12; Rev 2:2, 14-16, 20-25",

    "content": "Letters to the Seven Churches\nIn the letters to the seven churches of Asia (Rev 2–3), John uses a single literary pattern. Each letter begins with an address to the “angel of the church” in a particular city, followed by an aspect of Christ’s appearance taken from the vision of the Son of Man (1:12-18). Christ states that he knows each church and describes the state of the church in that city. He then gives advice or judgment for the church along with a promised reward for obedience. Each time, Christ emphasizes the need for full attention to the Spirit’s message to the churches.\nIt is common for interpreters to separate the seven letters into seven distinct messages and to make them symbolic of seven types of people or seven distinct periods of time. However, the seven letters were first of all letters from Christ to specific local churches in Asia. Christ knows each local congregation, and he encourages each to follow him faithfully. These letters also form a single, unified message that can speak to the church in all times and places, taking into account all its spots and wrinkles. In other words, any single body of Christians might be similar to one of these churches, and each community contains people who are like the Christians from these churches. Christ invites every community of believers to examine itself in the light of all of these messages.\nPassages for Further Study\nRev 2:1–3:22",

    "content": "Security and Obedience\nThe thought of one’s name being erased from the Book of Life (Rev 3:5) may raise questions about the security of salvation: Doesn’t the New Testament assure believers that their salvation is secure?\nThe New Testament is filled with words of assurance (e.g., John 10:27-30; 1 Cor 10:13; Heb 6:18-20), but it also contains stern warnings (e.g., John 15:6; 1 Cor 10:6-12; Heb 6:4-8; Rev 2:4-5; 3:11). We often dislike and avoid the warnings because they threaten our sense of security. Yet this concern for security is the precise reason that the New Testament writers issued their warnings. They stressed the importance of obedience, faithfulness, and endurance.\nThis call to obedience was nothing new. God repeatedly called the people of Israel to be faithful (e.g., Gen 12:1-2; 15:1-18; 22:16-18; 28:13-14; 1 Sam 12:19-25; 15:10-11; 28:16-19; 2 Sam 7:11-16; 1 Kgs 9:4-9). All the promises and predictions of God are conditioned upon faithfulness and obedience (see especially Jer 18:7-10). Paul realized that the disobedience of Israel had led to some of them being “broken off” (Rom 11:17), and he clearly warned Gentile Christians not to become overconfident of their position (Rom 11:13-32). The promise of God is unchanged, but human disobedience brings judgment. Humble obedience and dependence on God are the basis for genuine security.\nAt the time when the New Testament was written, it was costly and threatening to be a Christian. The book of Revelation promises a secure hope for believers in Christ despite the threat of death, but this hope is set clearly within the context of warnings about judgment (Rev 21:8, 27; 22:15). The call to faithfulness and obedience is a major theme in Revelation (see 2:5, 10-11, 16-17, 26-29; 3:2, 12, 17-19, 21-22; 7:14; 13:9-10, 12; 16:15; 18:4; 20:12; 21:7; 22:3, 7, 11-12). The New Testament clearly affirms that with God’s help, faithful Christians will persevere to the end (see Heb 13:6; Jas 1:25; Rev 3:10).\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 15:1, 13-16; 1 Sam 12:22-25; 1 Kgs 9:4-9; Jer 18:7-10; John 10:27-30; 15:6; Rom 11:13-32; 1 Cor 10:6-12; Heb 6:4-8, 18-20; 13:6; Jas 1:25; Rev 2:5, 10-11, 16-17; 3:5, 10-12; 18:4; 20:12; 21:7-8; 22:11-12",

    "content": "The Theater and Revelation\nUnderstanding the ancient theater can help us to understand Revelation 4–5. This passage introduces a divine drama and highlights the significance of God’s agent (the Messiah) in world history. This passage also sets the stage for the great drama of the book, which is about the world, the reality of judgment, and the victory that comes through the Lamb. In these chapters, a series of tableaus (scenes) is used to communicate the message.\nThe passage opens by describing God on his heavenly throne (4:1-3). In the ancient theater, a divine persona was placed in a central box or throne high above the stage. This actor clarified the significance of each scene for the audience through positive and negative comments or solved dilemmas in the script when they became too complex for the characters on stage to handle. Similarly, readers of Revelation should watch for scenes where God or his messengers interpret or intervene to advance the message.\nThe ancient drama took place on the stage below the divine figure. Between the stage and the audience, an orchestra of speakers voiced the emotional climate of the play. In Revelation, the four living creatures have a similar role (4:6-8). The twenty-four elders (representatives of the old and new covenants; 4:4) provide an antiphonal chorus (alternating groups of speakers or singers) and the historical setting for this great drama. God supplies the script, and only his special agent, the Lamb, can open it, read it, and perform it (5:1-5; 6:1).\nPassages for Further Study\nRev 4:1–5:14",

    "content": "Symbolic Numbers\nNumbers used in Scripture have often inspired wild speculation. An understanding of the symbolism of numbers in the ancient world can help ground our interpretation. Such symbolism, however, is not rigid or exact, so great care must be exercised when numbers are used in interpretation, so as not to push fanciful predictions about future events.\nThe number one can refer to God’s oneness (Deut 6:4; Gal 3:20; Jas 2:19). Two is the minimum number required to give a legitimate witness (Deut 17:6; Rev 11:3), and three can imply divine representation (Gen 18:1-2; 2 Cor 13:14; Rev 1:4-5). Four can stand for the known world, represented in Revelation by living creatures, horsemen, winds, and angels (Rev 4:6-8; 6:1-8; 7:1) and in Genesis by four rivers (Gen 2:10-14). When three and four are added to make seven, they represent perfection or divine fulfillment, indicating that God and the world are in harmony. The multiplication of three by four yields twelve, the number associated with God’s people (Gen 35:22-26; Exod 24:4; 28:21; Num 17:2; Josh 4:3-8; 1 Kgs 18:31; Matt 10:1-4; 19:28; Jas 1:1; Rev 12:1; 21:12–22:2. The number five and its multiples, such as ten, represent human completeness (e.g., five fingers per hand); and six carries a negative sense or implication of evil, being neither humanly complete (five) nor divinely complete (seven).\nMultiples of ten (e.g., forty) are a symbolic way to indicate many, whereas three sixes (666) imply supreme evil (Rev 13:18). One thousand is regarded as the foundational large number; 12,000 indicates a large number of God’s people (Rev 7:5-8); and 144,000 represents the complete people of God (Rev 7:4; 14:1). The number 10,000 and its multiples are probably best transliterated from Greek as myriads, since they really mean “a huge number” rather than a precise count.\nWhile some of the numbers in the Bible have symbolic meanings, using numbers to speculate on the time of Christ’s return or of the end of the world is highly dubious—only God possesses that knowledge (Mark 13:32). God did not intend for the symbolic numbers in Revelation to help us predict the future; rather, their symbolic meanings help to explain the significance of the visions. Because the numbers are symbolic, sometimes when we translate them into contemporary sizes, distances, and numbers for our ease of reading, it can result in the loss of theological significance. The use of these symbolic numbers can illuminate a vision’s relationship to the world or to the people of God.\nPassages for Further Study\nGen 2:2-3; 4:15; 15:13; 41:53-54; Exod 20:6; 25:31-37; 32:15; Lev 16:14; 23:16; 2 Sam 24:13; 1 Kgs 4:26; 17:21; 18:31, 43-44; Job 1:2; Ps 90:4; Jer 15:3; 49:36; Ezek 14:21; Dan 4:16, 23-25; 7:3, 17, 24; Zech 4:2; 6:1; Matt 10:1-5; 12:40; 18:21-22; Mark 6:7; Luke 15:8; Acts 6:3; 10:16; 1 Cor 8:6; Eph 4:4-6; 2 Pet 3:8; Rev 1:16; 2:10; 4:4; 6:1; 7:1, 4-8; 12:1, 3; 13:1; 17:3-14; 20:2-7; 21:12-21",

    "content": "The Purpose of the Judgments\nWhat is the purpose of God’s judgments? Are they meant to bring about redemption or are they simply intended to destroy? The account of judgments in Revelation gives us some clues:\nAt the end of the sixth trumpet, in spite of all the plagues, people “still refused to repent of their evil deeds and turn to God” (9:20-21). For some people, it does not matter what happens to them—they will not change even under pressure.\nThe tormented sufferers of the fifth trumpet sought death rather than looking to God (9:6). Many prefer to die rather than to admit their sin.\nIn the sixth seal (6:12-17), the people cried for the rocks to fall on them and hide them from “the wrath of the Lamb” (6:16). Their seeking escape from judgment shows fear rather than trusting in God.\nRevelation emphasizes the ultimate justice of God (16:5-7) and the principle of retribution. Believers and unbelievers alike will receive exactly what they deserve (see 2:23; 11:18; 14:13; 18:6; 20:12-13; 22:12).\nThe judgments are God’s partial answer to the prayers of the saints for retribution. Judgment occurs in God’s time, not ours (6:9-11; 8:2-5).\nThe judgments, like the plagues on Egypt, disprove the power of the earthly gods and of God’s enemies (Exod 7:8-12; 12:12; cp. Rev 13:4-17; 19:20-21; 20:9-10).\nThe judgments are a part of God’s mission and offer a last chance to repent (14:6-7; see 9:20-21; 16:9, 11, 21).\nEven though God has made it clear that sin is wrong and judgment is coming (Rom 2:5-11), many people still refuse to repent and accept God’s grace (Rom 1:32). Even in the final days, when God sends his witnesses to prophesy concerning the coming destruction, many people will prefer to align themselves with evil forces and will gloat over the demise of God’s prophets (11:3-10). Those who thus oppose God and flee from him will eventually be excluded from his presence.\nJudgment against disobedience and evil ways is inevitable (see Rom 1:18–2:11). Yet God patiently waits for repentance and offers his grace (see Rom 2:4; 2 Pet 3:8-10). As such, the warnings of these judgments can serve as an opportunity for change.\nPassages for Further Study\nExod 6:6; 12:12; Lev 26:25; 2 Kgs 17:7-23; Ps 103:6; Prov 16:11; Isa 13:11; 26:21; 59:18; Jer 5:1-9; Ezek 11:21; 39:21-24; Zeph 1:12; Mal 3:5; Luke 12:47; John 5:30; Rom 2:2-11; Heb 2:1-4; 10:29; Rev 9:20-21",

    "content": "The Antichrist\nThe term antichrist appears only in John’s letters (1 Jn 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 Jn 1:7). John expected many antichrists to appear in history (1 Jn 2:18), all of whom would deny that Jesus is both divine and human (1 Jn 2:22; 4:2-3; 2 Jn 1:7).\nPaul speaks of a “man of lawlessness,” who will come in the last days to stir up rebellion against God (2 Thes 2:1-12). This figure will “come to do the work of Satan,” chiefly by means of deception. Though not specifically labeled as “antichrist,” this “man of lawlessness,” like the “antichrists” described in John’s letters, will stand in opposition to the truth.\nIn Revelation 13, the hostile spirit opposed to Christ is personified by “another beast” who serves the dragon (Satan) and the first beast. The number of this antichrist, 666, probably stood for Nero and perhaps for the emperor Domitian (see study note on 17:8). Emperor worship—which proclaimed “Caesar is Lord!”—was a pseudo-religion that stood in opposition to proclaiming Christ as Lord.\nWhether John expected a final antichrist even greater than a political figure like Nero or Domitian is uncertain. Either way, Christians must take seriously the presence of evil and its opposition to Christ in the people and power structures of the world. Resisting these enemies may lead to persecution and even death, but our hope rests in ultimate victory through Christ.\nPassages for Further Study\n2 Thes 2:3-10; 1 Jn 2:18, 22; 4:2-3; 2 Jn 1:7; Rev 13:11",

    "content": "The Worship of Angels\nScripture often presents angelic figures as startling beings, whose appearance generates a response of awe or fear (e.g., Josh 5:13-15; Luke 2:8-10). Yet angels have a servant role and are not to be worshiped (Heb 1:5-14; Rev 19:10). Jewish tradition had developed the concept of angels as mediators. In pre-Christian Judaism, God’s transcendence or “otherness” was emphasized to such an extent that people felt mediators were needed in order to communicate with him. In this context, angels grew in importance.\nFor Christians, Christ has a unique role as mediator between God and humans. An interest in angels or deceased saints as providing a means to communicate with God can easily get in the way of honoring Christ as the sufficient mediator between God and human beings (1 Tim 2:5-6; see also 2 Cor 5:19-21; Heb 7:24-25). God still has angelic messengers, but they are creatures who serve him, not divine beings to be worshiped. God alone is worthy of our prayers and our worship.\nPassages for Further Study\nActs 27:23-24; 2 Cor 5:19-21; 1 Tim 2:5-6; Heb 1:5-14; 7:24-25; Rev 19:10",

    "content": "The Thousand Years (The Millennium)\nRevelation 20 describes the 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth. Three perspectives regarding how the millennium relates to the coming of Christ have been held by Christian groups with an equally high regard for Scripture as God’s inspired, authoritative word:\n1. Premillennialism: The current age between Christ’s first and second comings will end when he returns to inaugurate a literal 1,000-year rule on earth with his holy people, after which Christ will execute the final judgment and inaugurate his eternal Kingdom.\n2. Amillennialism: The “1,000 years” represents the current age between Christ’s first and second comings, in which Christ reigns spiritually with his people (i.e., there is not a literal 1,000-year period). At the end of this age, Christ will return, execute the final judgment, and inaugurate his eternal Kingdom.\n3. Postmillennialism: During the current age following Christ’s first coming, Christ will establish through the church an age of peace on earth (the 1,000 years), at the end of which Christ will return, execute the final judgment, and inaugurate his eternal Kingdom.\nDifferences over these perspectives have caused conflict among Christians. Many have forsaken Christian fellowship with those who hold a different opinion. True Christian humility and love would never let such differences disrupt Christian fellowship, however (see 1 Pet 3:8).\nAll believers can agree about the overall message of Revelation: Christ will visibly return and rule in an actual new heaven and earth. A real spiritual warfare is taking place. Hell, like heaven, is real, and all people will be judged by God’s standards. The prophecies of Revelation offer hope to God’s people in the midst of pain, suffering, and confusion in the world.\nPassages for Further Study\nRev 20:1-10",
