      "reasoning": "Both Peter and John use 'elder' (presbyteros) as self-designation rather than apostle. This literary parallel shows similar pastoral self-positioning in late first-century context. Both apostles adopt humble elder identity when writing to churches, emphasizing shepherding role over hierarchical authority."

      "reasoning": "2 John addresses 'the lady chosen by God and to her children, whom I love in the truth' echoing 1 John's 'let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.' Both emphasize love in truth as authentic rather than superficial. John consistently links love and truth as inseparable realities across his epistles."

      "reasoning": "Identical opening formula in both epistles: 'The elder, to [recipient], whom I love in the truth.'

      "reasoning": "Gospel's 'the truth will set you free' echoes in 2 John's 'truth lives in us and will be with us forever.' Both present truth as indwelling, active reality rather than mere proposition. John consistently portrays truth as personal presence (connected to Christ and Spirit) rather than abstract concept."

      "reasoning": "Gospel's 'Spirit of truth...lives with you and will be in you' directly echoes in 2 John's 'truth...lives in us and will be with us forever.' The parallel language (indwelling, permanence) shows John equating truth with Spirit. This is thematic echo with near-quotation level similarity, connecting Paraclete theology to epistolary truth emphasis."

      "reasoning": "1 John's 'if we claim to be without sin...the truth is not in us' parallels 2 John's emphasis on truth dwelling within. Both use 'truth in us' language to describe authentic faith versus deception. John consistently uses indwelling truth as litmus test for genuine belief."

      "reasoning": "1 John's 'we know that we belong to the truth' parallels 2 John's 'because of the truth, which lives in us.' Both connect truth to assurance and identity. John consistently presents truth not as external doctrine but as defining reality of believers' existence."

This is standard early Christian epistolary convention showing literary parallel. The triadic benediction appears across NT letters as fixed greeting formula."

This is more than thematic echo\u2014it's direct allusion bordering on quotation.

      "reasoning": "Both 1 and 2 John refer to love command as simultaneously old and new: 1 John says 'not writing you a new command but an old one'; 2 John says 'not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning.' Direct literary parallel showing John's consistent handling of this paradox\u2014the command is ancient (OT Shema) yet renewed (Jesus' new command)."
